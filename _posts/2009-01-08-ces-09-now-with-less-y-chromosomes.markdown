Last night was Microsoft's [CES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show) 2009 Keynote. If you didn't [watch it](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=B4471FA096919DB2) (and I'm assuming you wouldn't), you didn't miss much. The [best part](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2009/01/08/video-girl-builds-game-with-kodu-beats-robbie-bach-at-it/) is probably depicted above. They had a girl come onstage to show how easy to use something was, and... well, she got that wonderful description you see above. She was showing off some new game called "Kodu", where you can make your own games. It's pretty funny: the non-programmers see this and think it looks incredibly powerful and confusing, but when programmers look at it they think it looks limited and boring.

Anyways, no new Zune or Xbox news came out. Lamesauce. Marius is excited about Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7, but I'm never up to date with my operating systems, so it's not that great looking to me.
