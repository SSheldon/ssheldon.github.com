So, in order to support some of my friends, I went and watched the Junior Varsity and Varsity Girls' Soccer games today. It was quite a long time, and at times a tad it chilly, but the games weren't a disappointment.




**** 




**Junior Varsity:** Final score 3-1, Gators




 




The first goal in this game was scored by Jacobs... on Jacobs. The ball bounced off of one of their players into the goal. I watched with Keough and Irish and it was a well-played game. 'Grats to all!




 




**Varsity:** Final score 4-2, Gators




 




This game was interesting. The ref seemed to be missing a lot of calls or making poor calls, but fortunately most were in our favor. I watched this game with Hawkan, and we joked around for a lot of the game. The Jacobs parents were getting pretty pissed off. At one point, a kid sitting by me said something, and one of the Jacobs parents yelled at his and a conversation ensued that went something like this (I have a very bad memory, so don't quote me):




"Hey Jacobs, why don't you just go home?"




"[Blah blah] you should just be quiet, you dork!"




"You're a dork!"




"You watch your mouth!"




It was hilarious. I was laughing like no other. The Jacobs parents also kept getting worked up about the calls, so whenever they complained Hawkan and I would say one of the following:




"She had it coming!"




"She got in the way!"




"Nice call, ref! Good knowledge of the game!"




It was funny. Anyways, in the end South won. Well played, Varsity, well played. Congrats on a good season!
