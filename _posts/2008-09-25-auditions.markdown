I got an 82. Could have been worse. With the current standings (one Symphonic Band flute still to audition) that puts me at second chair, behind, again, a prodigal freshman girl (at least it's only one this time, not 3 like last year). Ugh. So close! Ah well. An 82 approximates to a 135 on the old scale, which is better than anything I did then. My audition sounded much better when I was practicing it. I kind of choked up on some of the etude, actually messed up the chromatic, bombed the sight-reading, and blanked out momentarily for my scales. At least it's over now. Who knows, maybe the freshman girl will be too scared to do solos. And maybe the remaining flute will beat me too. Anyways, I should probably go start my essay now. Oh dear.


[Additionally, congrats to Runnan on his accomplishment.](http://ponspk.blogspot.com/2008/09/happiness-and-procrastination-for.html)

**Update:** Of course, Anthony got an 86. Looks like I'm 3rd chair now.
