Today was exciting!~ Maybe I should stop doing a daily recap if I have nothing to talk about...




 




We're still watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in English. I played some more Halo tonight. Avalanche never seems to get old. I love it. At scouts I worked on Math. Nothing interesting happened.




 




That's all for today. Maybe tomorrow will be interesting...~
