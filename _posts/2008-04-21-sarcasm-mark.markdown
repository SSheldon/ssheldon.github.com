Well, if any of you are familiar with the series of tubes that we call "teh internets", you might know that sarcasm can be an issue here. You see, sometimes sarcasm doesn't come through text so well. Because of this, [people have come up with plenty of ways to denote sarcasm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm_mark). The only problem is that we don't have a universal or efficient method yet. Seeing as [English has no official language regulating body](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_regulators), the only way that this change can come about is simply through popular use. And, with this grandiose plot in mind, I present to you the snark:

Beautiful, isn't it? It's easy to type and already on our keyboards! You can also change it depending on what punctuation you would normally use: .~ ,~ ;~ !~ ?~ . Nobody uses the [tilde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde) anyways (shut up Spaniards, no one cares about you). From now on, whenever you want to ensure that your sarcasm is explicitly understood you can use the snark; that way, you can avoid confusion. But isn't confusion great?~ If you, like me, are a nerd, feel free to check out more on the subject at [Typophile](http://www.typophile.com/node/28817) and [Mother Tongue Annoyances](http://www.mtannoyances.com/?p=569).
