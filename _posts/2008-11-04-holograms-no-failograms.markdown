So, as you probably know, [there was an election going on today](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008). I spent the evening at Mike's watching CNN's coverage. Over the course of the night I was exposed to something truly fascinating: [holograms](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/pl_ynews/ynews_pl132)!

_"Help me _[_Wolf Blitzer_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Blitzer)_, you're my only hope..."_

Needless to say, the "holograms" were an embarassing epic fail.

In other news, this mess of a presidential election [is finally over](http://xkcd.com/500/). (Congrats on the 500th comic, xkcd!) Congratulations to the new president-elect, [Barack Obama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama). At the risk of losing my impartiality, Obama has a sweet logo. I think I will show it here.
