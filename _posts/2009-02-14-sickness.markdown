I am sick. Well, at this point I think I'm pretty well recovered, but I was sick. I missed a day of high school due to sickness for the first time yesterday. And I was supposed to be going to MCC for debate. Not cool. Doc thinks I've got a sinus infection and I might have the flu, too. I was really out of it on Thursday; it was really bad then. I spent both periods of Physics asleep while my lab partners did the lab for me (sorry about that again, guys). Anyways, I'm on some antibiotic now and I'm taking all sorts of medicine, so I should be good. [NyQuil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NyQuil) does strange things to a person...
