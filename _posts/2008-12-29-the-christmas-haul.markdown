Oh yeah, Christmas just passed. Merry Christmas to all. I guess I forgot to talk about it because [I'm enjoying my winter "break" so much](http://clpanther.blogspot.com/2008/12/twelve-complaints-of-christmas.html). Since I am grasping at straws here, desperately trying to find posting material, I guess I just make a list of what I got. Sounds reasonable, right?






  * [Fable II](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/f/fable2/)

  * [Left 4 Dead](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/l/left4dead/)

  * [Xbox 360 Wireless Headset](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360wirelessheadset/)

  * [The Order of the Stick: War and XPs](http://apegames.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=GIPOTS03&Category_Code=OOTSB)

  * [Runnan Revolution T-Shirt](http://www.cafepress.com/runnan.282600458)

  * 500GB [Iomega Prestige Desktop Hard Drive](http://store.iomega.com/section?SID=3d51fe130b41a88f5b919f7ef783aebe3ed:4760&secid=40119)


There were other, less extravagant Â items in addition to these, such as [Rolos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolo), [Microsoft Points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Points), and [money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote) from relatives. If you pay any attention to my Xbox Live activity (unlikely) you will notice that I have been playing the crap out of my two new games. They are both fantastic, and I am hopelessly addicted to Fable II. This is why I try to keep RPGs away from myself during schooling time.
