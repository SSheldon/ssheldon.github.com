This day was Saturday the 14th (Marius' birthday!). It was a day in the car. Rather uneventful. We woke up early in the morn, I showered at the hotel and got to use the piece of sandpaper that they call a "towel". I spent the rest of day either sleeping, listening to music, or learning more C# coding. I learned event handling! Yay me and anyone else who knows what that means! I also started developing some dreadful allergies; plenty of sneezing and itchy eyes. We had to make up for some good ground after the horrible traffic jam that was the previous day. Breakfast was at the hotel, lunch was at a Subway, and dinner was at Wall Drug. It's some drug store (in the old sense of the word) that was started a long time ago. Now it's just a giant tourist trap. Their claim to fame is that they have signs everywhere. Seriously. There were a ton. We fell for the trap and figured that if there were that many signs, it must be good. Logical, right? No. It was a gift shop and an incredibly overpriced crappy food court. It was a huge waste of time and money. The only good thing was that they had life-size [jackalopes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackalope) in the gift shops! I snapped some crappy cell pics:

Oh, and a flying jackalope:

We finally arrived at the campsite at 9ish, and we set up the camper. I was pretty tired, so I just went to sleep. The actual vacation should begin tomorrow.
