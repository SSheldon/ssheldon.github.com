Two days ago, on Tuesday, I left to go to [Racine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racine,_Wisconsin) to attend Amanda's graduation party. It was on her boat, but I think it's fair to call a boat of that size a yacht. Marius drove me up there. It was the first time I had been driven by a friend on the highway. It was like a road trip; we got lost a couple times because we were having troubles with the [TomTom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TomTom), but in the end no one died. His stupid air conditioning is broken, though, so we had to drive with the windows down, which meant the music had to be loud and both of us were suffering from allergies.




There were a bunch of band geeks at the party, and a good time was had by all. We spent a fair amount of time just hanging out on the boat, and we also went swimming in the marina pool. Everyone brought dress clothes, and we went out to dinner to [Salute, some Italian restaurant](http://www.saluterestaurant.us/). 'Twas good; I had the cheese ravioli, and it was a struggle to finish them, but in the end I was victorious.




After dinner all the people that weren't staying there for the night left. The rest of us were taking dramatic pictures at this lookout at the end of the marina.




We went back on the boat and watched [Princess Mononoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke); it was really good. I've never watched a [Miyazaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki) movie in its entirety, but I liked this one. After the movie we all went to bed. Yes, the boys and girls were all on the same boat, and some of us were even in the same room. GASP!




I woke up early the next morn to leave because I was going with Marius and he had to get home early. The drive back was uneventful. I was dead tired, but no one died. All in all, it was a fun party. Congratulations on graduating, Amanda!
