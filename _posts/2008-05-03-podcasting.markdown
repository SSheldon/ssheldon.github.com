It's what I'm intrested in now, mk? Seeing as I've put out two podcasts, I think I can be considered an expert.</sarcasm> Anyways, I just felt like documenting my methods:




 




**_Creation_**






  * Communication: [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) 

  * Recording: [PowerGramo](http://www.powergramo.com/) 

  * Editing: [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)


**_Publishing_**






  * File Hosting: [HotlinkFiles.com](http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/) 

  * Feed Creation: [Windows Live Spaces](http://spaces.live.com/) 

  * Embedding File in Feed: [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/)



Podcasting: so easy, even you can do it!
