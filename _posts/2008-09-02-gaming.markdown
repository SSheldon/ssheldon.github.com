So I've been playing a lot of good games recently, and each time I play a new one I think, "I should share the greatness of this game in a blog post!" And then I forget. So since I just got my computer back, here are some words on games I've been playing recently:




 




**_Civilization Revolution_**




[Civilization Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_Revolution) is [a Civilization game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)) for the console. The first thought to run through one's head, then, is that the game has been dumbed-down for console gamers. While I will not deny that the game includes less of the complexities of it's computer predecessors, I would most definately not say that it has been dumbed-down. It has been streamlined. Besides things such as the thinning of the tech tree and the units, most of the major gameplay changes come from one chage: there are no more workers. Because of the lack of workers units no longer require certain resources to build, pollution no longer occurs, and roads are built from city to city through the city menu. While PC players immediately balk at this, it is actually a good change. Did anyone enjoy clearing pollution? Clearing forests? Being screwed over because you lacked a resource? Spending time buiding roads between all your cities? With this change, the game moves much more quickly. While previously playing a game of Civilization was a daunting undertaking, games are now usually completed in less than 2 hours. The removal of the tedious and boring portions of Civilization have honed this game down to its very essence; what remains is an incredibly addicting and fun game.




 




**_Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2_**




[Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars:_Retro_Evolved_2) is an incredible game in the arcade sense.




 




**_Braid_**




[Braid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game)) is an incredible game in the artistic sense.




 




**_Castle Crashers_**




[Castle Crashers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Crashers) is an incredible game in the entertaining sense.




 




And now, in honor of [micro-writing](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1834674,00.html), here are four word reviews for each game:




Civilization Revolution: Rule the world faster!




Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2: Addicting... DAMN GREEN BOXES!




Braid: Confusing puzzles, stunning atmosphere.




Castle Crashers: Explosive defecation is funny.
