So [Grand Theft Auto IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV) releases today. Lots 'o people are excited about it. I've never played a GTA game before, so I don't really care. I also don't know anyone who plays GTA, so I've got no way of becoming interested in it. If I played a GTA game, I feel like [I'd be lost in the vastness of it](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/4/28/).Â Even if I wanted the game, I'm thinking my parents might not allow this one. I dunno, maybe if they didnt know anything about it... I wonder if Best Buy accepts Drivers Licenses to make you old enough to play M games. Regardless, I'm not even sure if I want the game, so it doesn't matter...
