[Beware the McCainiacs!](http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-04-21-candidates-WWE_N.htm)




 




So Juniors were taking [ACT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_(examination))s today. It's pretty retarded how much they get pampered. They close of all of frickin' C hall so that no one will disturb them and have people guard the hallway and yell at kids who close their lockers too loudly. Seriously! I'm really hoping my eardrums won't be that fragile by next year. They get to go home early too, but whatever. That'll be nice. My entire Math class was empty, so the sophmores and lone senior debated with our sub. He was trying to convince us that we won't be able to get by in life unless we lurn limits. Bull. He tried to prove that we needed to learn more math by throwing trick questions at us, but he just succeed in annoying me.




 




I got a copy of the school newspaper today. It's so embarassing. The grammar and spelling are horrible. I'm considering taking a red pen to all of it and then giving it to the editor. There's one article in there that I totally disagree with, but I plan to write a comprehensive response to the newspaper. You'll hear more about it later.




 




We finished "[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo's_Nest_(film))" today. I totally called the ending. I knew that it couldn't end happily; after all, we're watching it in English class. I was wondering how they could make the ending depressing, and my guess was that Mack would die from a [lobotomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy). I was close enough.
