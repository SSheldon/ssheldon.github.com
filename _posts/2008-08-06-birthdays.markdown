So Katie's birthday was on the previous Sunday (Aug 3) and my Mom's was yesterday (Aug 5). Exciting, no? For Katie's birthday I went to [Six Flags Great America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_Great_America) with her, her family, and Jess. Good fun was had by all. We rode some crazy roller coasters, ate some crazy expensive food, and told some crazy jokes. Happy birthday, birthday people!




Oh, the things you find at Great America...
