Everyone loves [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/). Unfortunately, xkcd's comic feed and blog feed are two seperate entities. Because of this, I was not aware of an absolutely hilarious story that was posted on the blog. [Read it. Now.](http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/09/23/federal-reserve-skateboard-a-short-story/) Runnan ought to really like it...
