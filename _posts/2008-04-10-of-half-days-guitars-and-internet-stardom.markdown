Today was a half-day. Terribly exciting, in'nit? School rushed by, which unfortunately meant less time for me to sleep in Study Hall (or in this case, do Chem homework I forgot...)




 




We were told that today we would "play a game" in Chemistry. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting a frickin' Xbox to be brought in or something, but I figured we'd do somethig out of the ordinary where we could have fun. Well, turns out the whole thing was a joke. It wasn't a game, it was just a lab. And not even a very good one at that. Now I'm all for a good joke and I can see the humor in this, but... I dunno. I trust my teachers and to have such an outright lie just for a joke's sake was rather disappointing. This wasn't like the teacher said, "and now we're going to play a game," and handed out the lab; this is something that was mentioned weeks ago, so I was genuinely looking forward to it. It's just disappointing to look forward to something and then realize you were lied to. I suppose it's all trivial, but it was just disconcerting. That, and that I needed something to take up space in this post.




 




So, being a half-day, I had an increased amount of time in the afternoon which I could seize and use to spend time with friends or go out for lunch or something! This, of course, means that my usual happened: I ended up sitting at home playing video games. I had originally planned to attempt the Endless Setlist with my bandmate, but on further investigation it became apparent that Marius was leaving for RYLA for the weekend by the end of the day, so I wanted to hang out with him. That didn't work out because of packing issues apparently, but we played some CoD4.




 




Speaking of video games, I took the plunge and bought Ikaruga. I was kind of shocked to learn that it only has 5 levels, and after thoroughly beating the first I came upon the second. Wow. Level 2 and I'm already horribly stuck and frustrated. It is a lot of fun, but when the reviews say it is obscenely hard, they mean it. I have to go buy more Microsoft Points now so that I can afford the Halo maps when they come out.




 




My brother has taken a renewed interest in the guitar, and he is now trying to learn to play the beginning of "[One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_(Metallica_song))" on guitar. This prompted a sudden interest in guitar on my part, and I am now attempting to learn "[Still Alive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Alive#Soundtrack)". [Here is the guitar tab](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/j/jonathan_coulton/still_alive_tab.htm) if you'd like it. I really suck at guitar, but if I learn this song I will be very pleased.




 




I fancy myself as somewhat an Internet celebrity. I successfully conquered [2P START!'s Name That Game #5](http://www.2pstart.com/2008/04/09/name-that-game-5/) shortly after it was posted. But how, dear Steven, was this possible, you ask? Well, I was a Halo fanboy at a webcomic with a Nintendo fanboy audiece. I also have that promotional art as a giant poster in my room. Saying as much belittles my accomplishment though, so we shall just say that I am amazing.




 




[Infection is back in Halo 3 matchmaking!](http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=news&cid=13513) Maybe this time Bungie can use a gametype besides creeping dead? Seriously, that was not true infection. Creeping dead FTL!




 




I believe that's all I have to share about today. Tomorrow begins the weekend, and you all shall hear from me more at that point.
