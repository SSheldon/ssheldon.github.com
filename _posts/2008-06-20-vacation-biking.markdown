Today was a more laid-back day. We awoke late and had cinnamon rolls for breakfast (mmm). In the afternoon we embarked on a bike ride of epic proportions. It was pretty crappy. We rode 12~ miles round-trip from our campground to Crazy Horse. What no one told me was that the 6~ miles there were **all** uphill. Seriously, we climbed a mountain the entire way. It was absurd. While we were riding our bikes, it also started raining. Then it was hailing. Fortunately, we managed to find a tunnel to take shelter in. It was quite intense. Unfortunately, the path was entirely unpaved and the gravel got soggy after the rain. This made climbing the hills even more difficult. It was brutal. It's not so much that riding uphill is impossible, but it was always uphill. I kept thinking, "Just a little further and I can go downhill," but then I'd remember it wasn't going to happen. I think in the end we climbed 1000 feet in elevation or something.




 




Once we got to the top of the hill, we had lunch. Then came the fun part of this grueling ordeal: riding down. I didn't even have to pedal for 3 or 4 miles. It was really awesome. Quite a change from before. Unfortunately, it again started pouring and hailing. Greg was having a fun time purposefully riding through all the puddles; his clothes were destroyed afterwards.




 




Once we finally made it back to the camper everyone went to sleep; except I, of course. I finally got a working version of Minesweeper on the Zune! Finally! Once I release my first version there will be more hubbub, but for now just know that if you have a Zune you can be playing Minesweeper any day now!




 




So today was the last day. I'm happy to go home. Vacation's interesting and all, but I miss my home and my friends. I keep thinking I see people I know. No matter. I'll be home sometime on Sunday. I'll be sure to post a synopsis of the grueling ride home.
