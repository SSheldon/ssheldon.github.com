I went to Battle of the Bands last night with Runnan, Marius, and Katie. There were some good performances. It was damn cold. Here's the the places that the bands came in. I voted for The Con Men, personally. I wasn't paying attention when they announced the winners, so thanks to Caitlin for correcting me!

  1. [The Hudson Branch](http://www.myspace.com/thehudsonbranch) 
  2. [The Con Men](http://www.myspace.com/theconmenband) 
  3. [Torn Requiem](http://www.myspace.com/tornrequiem)

There were a lot of good performances. One band played Toxicity, which I enjoyed.
