So an update to [version 2.5 of the Zune software](http://zuneinsider.com/archive/2008/05/06/zune-spring-update.aspx) dropped yesteday. It's a good update so far. I can create autoplaylists now (which apparently a lot of people wanted but I don't care about) and there are videos on the Zune Marketplace (but I don't buy videos, so that doesn't matter either...). The biggest things for me are the Zune software's ability to search for album information now, the fact that it uploads all song plays (even songs whose information it can't match in the database) to your Zune card, and the ability to sync your friends' Zune cards to your Zune and view them there. It's some pretty cool stuff.

The fact that the Zune software now uploads any plays is good because it, for some reason, could never get information for my songs so it said I had no plays. I'm still wrasslin' with the software and trying to get it to work somehow because it's still having some issues, but we'll see how that goes.

Oh, and also, [XNA will soon include tools for developing games on the Zune](http://zuneinsider.com/archive/2008/02/20/xna-studio-and-zune.aspx). We're one step closer to Hexic and Geometry Wars!
