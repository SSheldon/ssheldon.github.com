I got [a new flute](http://www.gemeinhardt.com/main.taf?p=1,3,1)! (This happened a while ago, pretend I'm up to date on my posting...) It'sÂ really awesome.

Isn't it a beaut? It sounds great, and I do love the gold lip plate (despite claims that it is girly or tacky...). It's open-hole, inline G, with a B foot and a gizmo key. You want more specs? It is a solid silver body with a gold plated lip plate and silver plated keys, has french pointed arms, 12 karat white gold springs, and drawn tone holes. Now if only I could play the flute decently...
