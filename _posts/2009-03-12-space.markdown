Space friggin' sucks. Seriously. Who cares about space? Today in Physics I ended up thinking about Halo and how awesome space is in that setting. Then [the news today](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090312/ap_on_sc/space_station) jarred me back to reality; the astronauts on the International Space Station had to hide because they almost got hit by space debris! Was it a giant meteor? An old satellite? No? It was a 5.5 inch wide chunk of metal. Oh. But it was a near miss? It came within 3 miles of the station? Mhmm. Spooky...




 




Space today is so boring. We send up fragile space equipment that doesn't do anything. We've got a space station, but are we docking ships at it and refueling them and sending them to the moon? No! We have 3 astronauts there sitting around! We went to the moon once. Did we build a colony? No! We put a flag there! We don't have [space elevators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator), we don't have [frigates](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/UNSC_Frigate), we don't have [FTL travel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light), we don't have [spaceships with guns](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Magnetic_Accelerator_Cannon), we don't have any colonies! What do we have? Space shuttles that can't take off without extra rockets attached to them and fat-ass space suits.




 




**[Update]** How to make space interesting:




 




"We're going for a space walk."




 




"Oh, are we going to deploy a satellite?"




 




"No, we're shooting space junk. Grab a rifle."




 




**[Update 2]**




 




"Apparently the crew members left an instruction manual on board and Fincke had to be told by Mission Control how to go about getting back onto the station once the threat had passed."
