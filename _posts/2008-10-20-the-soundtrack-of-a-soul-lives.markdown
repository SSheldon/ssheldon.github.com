So, [Runnan did some thing](http://ponspk.blogspot.com/2008/10/soundtrack-of-man-life-and-death-of.html) he came across on Facebook to make a soundtrack to his life. It's a little... MySpace-y for my tastes, but you come up with some pretty sweet connections. Here are the results of shuffling my Zune:






  1. Opening Credits: Here in My Room - Incubus 

  2. Waking Up: Cult of Personality - Living Colour 

  3. First Day At School: Crawl Away - Tool 

  4. Falling In Love: Dance with the Devil - Breaking Benjamin 

  5. Fight Song: Still Alive - Jonathan Coulton 

  6. Breaking Up: Rock Anthem for Saving the World - Martin O'Donnell 

  7. Prom: A Little Piece of Heaven - Avenged Sevenfold 

  8. Life: To Be a Man - Boston 

  9. Mental Breakdown: Dream On - Aerosmith 

  10. Driving: The Last Spartan - Martin O'Donnell 

  11. Flashback: Whatever It Takes - Lifehouse 

  12. Getting back together: I Die in Degrees - All That Remains 

  13. Losing your virginity: Graduation Day - Head Automatica 

  14. Wedding: Last Beautiful Girl - Matchbox Twenty 

  15. Birth of Child: Believe Me Natalie - The Killers 

  16. Final Battle: Brainpower - Freezepop 

  17. Funeral Song: This is Absolution - Killswitch Engage 

  18. Ending Credits: Ruby - Kaiser Chiefs 


I re-did the flashback song, because it was originally some Fall Out Boy song with a title too long to fit on my Zune screen. Screw that.
