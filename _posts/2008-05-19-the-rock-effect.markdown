This is a little "webcomic", I guess you could say, that I found a while ago. I thought it was clever but failed to show it to anyone. Why was it so clever? Well, of course, it mashed together two videogames I enjoy and made 'em funny. [Take a look at the webcomic here](http://www.gamespy.com/articles/837/837150p1.html).
