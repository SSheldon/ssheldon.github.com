So you just got a new phone? Unlimited SMS and MMS, you say? Well isn't that spiffy? No data plan though? No mobile web? That's a bummer. Don't fret, though! You'd be surprised how much you can do with simply SMS and MMS:

* (SMS) Subscribe to RSS feeds with [Pingie](http://www.pingie.com/) - That's right folks, there are services out there that will text RSS feed updates to your phone. Pingie is just the most visible one I found, but there are certainly others, including [Yahoo! Alerts](http://alerts.yahoo.com/), if that's your cup o' tea.
* (SMS) [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) - Ah, twitter. Of course you knew you could text things to it. Love it or hate it, it's something you can do with nothing more than SMS.
* (SMS) [Message people via AIM](http://mobile.aol.com/aolproducts/aimtxt) - Some of us still use AIM. Some don't. Talk to those that do on your SMS enabled phone through this handy service.
* (SMS) [Message people via Windows Live Messenger](http://home.mobile.live.com/home.mvc/ShowSmsUsage/Messenger) - Alright, whatever, no one uses Windows Live Messenger. I know enough folks that do that I'm including it on this list. Get over it.
* (SMS) [Email with Hotmail](http://home.mobile.live.com/home.mvc/ShowSmsUsage/Hotmail) - Checking email is nice, right? I'd say so.
* (SMS) [Message people via Yahoo! Messenger](http://mobile.aol.com/aolproducts/aimtxt) - And also, you can use Yahoo! Messenger. Why would you? No idea. I'm just including it here.
* (MMS) Upload photos to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) - This one here is only for those of us that can send MMS messages to email addresses. I know, I thought I wouldn't be in that group either, but I actually can! Get an upload to email address on Flickr and send your pictures to it. Subject is the picture's name and the text is the pictures description. Pretty neat, huh?
* (SMS) Text yourself from an email address - You may not realize, but your phone might have its own email address. [Figure out what it is](http://www.sms411.net/2006/07/how-to-send-email-to-phone.html), and you can text yourself from an email address! Why would you do that? Because you can. Now get to it!
* (SMS) Use [Google's search features](http://www.google.com/sms/) - Google can do some cool stuff for you. Want to know the weather? Local restaurants? How your stocks are doing? Google can help!

I've had texting for a day, and I've found all these nifty things that can be done. So don't bemoan your lack of mobile web, my friends; find alternatives. Use your unlimited messaging to its fullest potential!
