Today was an enjoyable day. The ass-kickingness of the Afrin wore off in the middle of the night, but I slept on. We had some crazy rain this morning. I love rain. It makes me stay inside and sounds very soothing. Along with this torrential rain came hail. Hail! It made an interesting noise atop the camper. Because of this rain, our morning plans were slightly delayed, so the morning moved at a less frenetic place.




 




The day was spent driving throughout the area. We were in [Custer State Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custer_State_Park), mainly driving on the [Needles Highway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needles_Highway). This road is crazy. It isn't really a highway, it's a scenic route. It has absurd hairpin turns and steep inclines and a couple tunnels cut into the rock that were barely big enough for our truck to fit through. There were some really awesome things that we saw on this route. If my mom gets the pictures on her Flickr I can try to link to some of them from here. We'd stop at points and Greg and I were climbing up the rocks. We got to some pretty sweet places. Those rocks are like perfect for climbing. Whenever we were driving and not looking at anything I was coding. Minesweeper is coming along nicely indeed.




 




One section of the highway went through a wildlife reserve were we saw an assortment of animals: buffalo, [donkeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_Burros), pronghorn antelope, a turkey thingy, some chipmunks, and some p-p-p-prairie dogs! The chipmunks and donkies (I like it spelled better that way) would eat food from our hands. Other than that, the animals acted like animals. Nothing shocking there. Also along the way we saw the army. I still can't figure that out. We've seen them everywhere since Wisconsin; the soldiers have been in their fatigues driving humvees around in towns. I can't quite figure it out...




 




The weather's been beautiful. I am able to comfortably wear long jeans and a sweatshirt. Lovely. We stopped for lunch and had a picnic (in the sense that we brought food and ate it outside. For dinner we ate at the café at Mount Rushmore. No complaints. So far this vacation is looking good. I'm doing a lot of coding and having an enjoyable time. Until my next update, ¡adiós!
