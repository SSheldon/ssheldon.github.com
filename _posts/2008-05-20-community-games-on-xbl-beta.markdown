[The Community games on Xbox Live beta launched today](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2008/05/20/announcing-community-games-on-xbox-live-beta.aspx). But quick, before you get excited: you need to have a [Creators Club Premium Membership](http://creators.xna.com/en-US/membership) to download games! What's that you say? You don't want to spend $100 a year to download crappy games? Well, me neither. Whatever happened to "democratizing game development"?
