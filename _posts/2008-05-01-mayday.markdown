'Twasn't a bad day. Took a Spanish Quiz and a Math Test without too much trouble.




 




Team SWAT launched for Halo 3 today. I haven't been having much luck, though. [In my first game](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/GameStatsHalo3.aspx?gameid=475324900&player=CouchPotato99), 2 people quit but I managed to still be MVP, and [in my second](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/GameStatsHalo3.aspx?gameid=475343277&player=CouchPotato99) one person quit but i still made MVP while my teammates combined got less than half my kills. Unfortunately, because the matchmaking system levels you up based on wins and losses, I'm barely levelling up becuase my teammates all suck.




 




[Episode 66 of the Xbox 360 Fancast](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/04/28/xbox-360-fancast-066-600-shy-of-evil/) came out on Monday, and I just got around to listening to it. They answered the question I submitted in it, and it was a pretty lengthy answer. How awesome am I? Internet fame!
