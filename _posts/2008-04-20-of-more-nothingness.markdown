So not much happened today, either. We made fleece blankets at confirmation. Ours turned out fine. I finally saw part of [Shaun of the Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_of_the_Dead). It's good so far but I haven't finished it. I got a haircut, finally. No more am I super shaggy. I also learned that "fast" is an adverb. Who'd'a thunk? The weather is really nice, which I'm not too happy about. I don't like heat. Oh well. Back to the grind tomorrow, eh?
