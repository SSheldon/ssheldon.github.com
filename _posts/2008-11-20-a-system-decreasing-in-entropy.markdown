It's been a while. My Anti-virus expired and I was lazy about updating it, so I had a fear of the internetz. I'm back now, though! Nothing interesting to say. [Runnan's cat is pretty sweet](http://ponspk.blogspot.com/2008/11/prom-first-glimpse-into-da-monies-more.html). If only the pictures weren't hosted on his blog, which absolutely sucks as a photo-hosting service...




 




I don't care what people say about Microsoft. Yesterday, I got 3 free quality games from them for my Zune and I got a drastic update to my Xbox 360, completely changing the experience of the Xbox. Say what you want, but when you buy something from Microsoft's entertainment division you know it's only going to get better. My Zune coudn't even play games when I got it; it couldn't show me what music my friends had listened to recently; it couldn't download songs over my wireless network. But now it can. And I haven't payed a dime for it to do all these things. Take _that_, iPod owners. The same goes for my Xbox; while such improvements have been taken for granted by PS3 and Xbox 360 owners, it's interesting to think that the Wii owner's console won't be getting much better and that all of our old consoles were the same way. Also, the 360's firmware is still ages ahead of the PS3, but that's a story for another day.




 




As I have alluded to, I got the [NXE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live#New_Xbox_Experience). I was indeed hesitant, but, despite all my thoughts against it, it won me over. The avatars are no where near a problem. They only exist on the dashboard unless you otherwise desire. They are, in fact... a welcome addition. The avatars were not designed for me or my ilk, that is certain; however, they are fleshed out enough that you can make a presentable representation of yourself. I was able to recognize some schoolmates on my friends list simply by their avatars. But these avatars are just fluff; let's get to the meat and potatoes. The new dashboard is wonderfully pretty. It's fast and responsive and very well organized. Microsoft has taken a lot of space for their promotions, but some of it is actually useful, so it can be forgiven. The new marketplace is easy to browse once you get the hang of it. However, above all else, the new guide is simply fantastic. Fast and responsive, it exposes you to many more options than the old. It is basically the old dashboard blades, compacted. My only qualm with it is the friends list; the text has been enlarged, so now I can only see 6 of my friends at once, which is a nuisance when you have 18 online. All in all, the NXE was well worth the wait. Seeing as apparently half of the features Microsoft wanted were cut, we'll have to see what it develops into over time.
