So, here's the schedule for 08-09 semester two. Anything in common? Hmmm, [it looks kind of familiar](http://ponspk.blogspot.com/2008/12/second-semester-schedule.html)... Not much different from [last semester](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/07/31/semester-1-schedule/), either.

Also, the world has again shown me that, while normally being cruel and merciless to me, it will show me great clemency within the academic sphere. I went to get my schedule changed from McMeel to Cameron for English, and it was already so! Also, when Runnan and I asked if we would need to test out of Intro to CS or take an equivalent course at MCC in order to get into AP CS, it was revealed to us that we needn't perform either option! Pats on the back all around. Maybe someday the world will make up for its cruelty through this manner. Only time can tell.
