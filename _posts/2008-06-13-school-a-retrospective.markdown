They finally decided to calculate the GPAs and class ranks! Final grades have been up for a while, but they finally did the calculations. I am pleased to announce that my class rank is now 2! Wooh! Sorry Jake, I'm sure you'll beat me eventually.

So, I guess this officially marks the end of my Sophmore year. It was interesting. There will be more posted here when I get the chance. Be patient!
