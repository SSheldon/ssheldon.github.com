It appears his transformation is complete. Michael has, completely and utterly, become a creature of teh internets. It started years ago with flash games, and recently came to a head when he started reading xkcd. Now... [he has a blog](http://www.clpanther.blogspot.com/). Curiously named CLPanther (CLP anther? CLP ant her? CL Pant her? CL Panther? See El Panther? Perhaps he professes a love for Panthers. Is Michael a furry?), this blog shows promise after his... wonderful initial post. (haha, just messin', Mike)

Yesterday I attended a Debate tournament; after years of trying, Michael and Runnan finally got me in. It was acceptable; I had a good time and gave two speeches. The debates are organized by the [ICDA](https://www.edline.net/pages/ICDA), if anyone cares. You should join. That means less research for me.

[Godwin's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law) was invoked in our chamber. Additionally, someone spoke of the Darfurians. We all know that the Darfurians are suffering, but why does no one care about the Dar[furries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom)?
