[Does anyone really care](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080515/ap_on_el_pr/obama_sweetie)? If you're a logical person, you can figure out that it is just term he uses unknowingly and without harsh intent. The only people who are concerned by this are over-the-top feminists and people who already know they won't vote for Obama. Political correctness is a thorn in this country's side.
