It's September 25th! A year ago I was excitedly playing Halo 3 on launch day. (And 3 days later my Xbox RRODed, but let's not talk about that) In honor of Halo 3's first birthday, [Bungie released a teaser trailer for a new Halo 3 campaign expansion](http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=15574). It's a pretty nifty trailer. Watch it!

Something found in the trailer would suggest the release date to be January 6th, 2009. If you're a nerd, like me, there's [an in-depth analysis of the trailer](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/09/25/x3f-tv-video-analysis-of-bungies-keep-it-clean-teaser/), too.
