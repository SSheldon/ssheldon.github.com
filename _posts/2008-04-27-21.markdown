Wow, it's been a while since I've posted, eh? I'm trying to give Runnan a chance to catch up :).




 




On Friday night I saw [21](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(2008_film)). It was good. I'd recommend it if you are considering seeing it.




 




**Spoilers will follow!**




So yeah, like the trailers would insinuate, it's about some college kid who [counts cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_counting). Long story short, they make loads of money, but the kid fights with the professor leading the team, so the professor robs the kid and gets him caught by the Vegas security people. The kid engineers some scheme to get back at the professor and all goes well. The movie pulls an "[Ocean's Twelve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean's_Twelve)", as I like to call it, in that they go, "Oh yeah, by the way, all this suspense was for nothing because we actually solved the problem 30 minutes ago and didn't tell you until now." Kind of annoying and unsatisfying. Oh well. Still a good movie. I suggest you watch it. Oh, and apparently it is based off of a [true story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Blackjack_Team).




**End of spoilers**
