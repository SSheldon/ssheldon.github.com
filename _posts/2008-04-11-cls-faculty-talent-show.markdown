So Katie, Jessica, and I went to the Faculty Talent show tonight. It was pretty good. $5 for admission, and all the proceeds go to the Crystal Lake and Lake in the Hills food pantries. It was hosted by Mr. Lanning and Mr. Krol, who just told corny jokes the whole time. Of note of their hosting was a teacher's look-a-like slideshow and Mr. Krol teasing Mr. Lanning about he and Ms. Deeken. These, however, were the performances: 

  * Corey Meidwig, Jessica Orgler, Rae Roane, Robin Rokosik, Lois Seiler  
"[Since U Been Gone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Since_U_Been_Gone)" -  This was a tapdance routine to the song. It was pretty good. Nothing spectacular.
  * Chris Keyes  
"Morceao de Concert" - This was a really well performed piece. I felt bad for Mr. Keyes because he actually had talent and an incredible skill, but most kids were just there to see their teachers do something weird, so there was a lot of talking during the performance. Otherwise it was top-notch, if only a little out of place. When Mr. Keyes critiques our playing in band now I'll have to respect that because I've seen how well he can do it. 
  * Catherine Carroll, Annette Miller, Mari Swift  
"Library's 10th Hour" - This was an... interesting skit. The Librarians ran around doing a dance routine in a library setting to the song "[Girls Just Want to Have Fun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_Just_Want_to_Have_Fun)". Nothing super. I also so called what the hosts were going to say afterwards: "So that's what happens in the library after school..." 
  * Matt Koll, Colleen Schneider, Ben Stoner  
"Leavin's not the Way to Go" - This was a good vocal trio performed by three teachers that are very good at singing. They were singing some good harmony parts that I enjoyed the sound of. 
  * The English Department  
"Notes on a Scandal" - This was a video filmed with all the English teachers. Watching them sneakily look at the floor to read their lines was pretty funny. Each scene had the English teachers discussing a "scandal" from a book that we read. Mr. Stoner was definately the best actor, but that's no surprise. Mr. Puma's cameo was pretty funny. The playing of this video was plagued with tecnical difficulties: they couldn't get the sound to work and the VGA cable kept coming loose and distrorting the colors. After they couldn't get it working, they did what all people lacking tech-savvy do: they decided to play the DVD on a Mac instead of the PC. 
  * Janelle Billings  
This was a comedy routine. It was rather strange listening to a teacher tell a bunch of inappropriate jokes. She said things like, "if your hands are beneath the desk and your fingers are moving at a mile a minute, we know you're texting, unless you're doing something really inappropriate," and "walking down the halls, I thought that, 'this school sees more action than my house has in 18 years of marriage.'" Kinda weird. A woman actually walked out with her child at one point and then came back after the performance. Watching Katie's jaw drop when she told these jokes was pretty funny though. If it was anyone besides a teacher it would have been hilarious, but it was just kind of akward.
  * Leah Deeken, Corey Meidwig, Lisa Nawracaj, Robin Rokosik, Jenny Sowka, Michelle Streit  
"Independent Women" - This was a dance routine by a bunch of the young female teachers. If you've been to a poms performance, you know exactly what it is like. They do a bunch of borderline raunchy dances to "hip" urban songs. Meh. Although, watching Ms. Nawracaj dance to "[Crank That](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_That_(Soulja_Boy))" in the wrong direction was pretty funny. 
  * [Andrew Thomas](http://www.myspace.com/andrewthomasmusic)  
?, "Traces of You", "Sometimes We Fall" - This was amazing. Mr. Thomas is an incredible artist, and I've included a link to his MySpace where you can hear some of his songs. It was awesome. He played two of his songs and then came back for an encore (which my cynical mind says was planned, but oh well). He sings and plays accoustic guitar. His songs were very well done and I was very jealous of how easy he makes switching guitar chords look. This was the closest I've ever been to being at a concert, and it was very neat. It was cool how he interacted with the audience. He would laugh whenever people yelled his name or something, and he told these people that were clapping at one point that it wasn't working for them (because they were trying to clap to some weird part). He even stopped playing at one point because he played the wrong chord, but it didnt make me think any less of him. All this was weird to me, because I'm so used to the rigidity of a performance from band, and seeing him be able to be loose on stage was cool. We were waving our cell phones overhead at one point (like lighters), but it didn't catch on so we gave up.

So, overall it was a very good show. Sucks to be you guys who missed it!
