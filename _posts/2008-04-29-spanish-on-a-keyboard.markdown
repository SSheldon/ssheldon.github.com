This is a neat little thing you can do: [http://www.studyspanish.com/accents/typing.htm](http://www.studyspanish.com/accents/typing.htm)

It allows you to type vowels with umlauts and accents, along with other characters and symbols, without having to memorize Unicode character entity refrences.

I also tried out [Type International Characters by UnicodeSoft](http://www.unicodesoft.com/). It's pretty nifty, but you can't add characters to its lists and it isn't freeware, so it gets a solid "meh" from me.

If anyone knows of an easy way to enter IPA characters so that I don't have to keep copying them from Wikipedia articles and then pasting them, I would greatly appreciate it if you told me.
