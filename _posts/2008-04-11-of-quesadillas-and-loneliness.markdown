Eventful day. Marius was gone for RYLA, which was weird because I kept thinking about talking to him only to realize he wasn't there. Apparently we are now supposed to be doing things in math that we never learned about. That's always frustrating. We finally finished Hamlet in English. I suppose the ending was decent, but I never got the impression that Fortinbras forcibly took over the capital as it was depicted in [the Branagh film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1996_film%29). We came in second place for [our awesome Intro to Business Presentation](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/04/09/the-ninth-of-april-my-rhymeth-is-nill/) behind "Fitness for Life", who earned 29% of the money compared to our 27%, a mere $150 difference. Boo. Oh well. We'll see who's the winner when grades are finished.

After school, I was expecting to be driven home by Katie, but she failed to realize that she doesn't get driven home on Fridays and then she missed her bus. We walked to my house and I showed her Ikaruga, an act she vehemently opposed for some reason. I drove her home, and then she and Jessica came back to my house shortly later. Spencer came over, too, and we were planning to all play videogames. Unfortunately for our plans, Jessica doesn't like playing video games, so that fell through. Katie, Spencer, and I played some Halo 3 while Jessica used the mic, and then when Spencer left I played CoD 4 so Jessica could talk there. She likes being a jerk to everyone. I don't like letting her do it because I don't want bad rep and I don't want to ruin people's gaming, but what am I supposed to say? Ah well, no harm was done.

[Katie, Jessica, and I went to the Faculty Talent show](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/04/11/cls-faculty-talent-show/). It was good fun.

After the show, we went to Domino's to eat... only to realize there isn't any seating there. Duh. I so called it. Anyways, we went to Taco Bell for my first time in remembered history. I had some quesadillas which were good excluding the sauce they put on the outside.  After Taco Bell, I returned home to blog for an hour and a half straight while Katie went to sleepover at Jessica's. This effectively left me friendless and lonely. Yay.
