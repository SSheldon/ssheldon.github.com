My computer is finally back! Delivery was originally attempted on Friday, but no one was here to sign for the package so it had to stay in a warehouse for the long weekend. I got it today, though. Apparently something was wrong with my "[Logic board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_board)"... except that only Macs have logic boards. I guess they meant my mother board. Stupid MicroMedics. Upon rebooting my computer, I was met with a message alerting me to the fact that ZoneAlarm Anti-Virus was disabled. Apparently it cannot run if your clock is at an incorrect time. It took me a while to figure that out, and then I had to upgrade to SP3 and then install 16 auto-updates. This is why you never should ignore your computer. Anyways, it's good to finallyÂ have a computer back!
