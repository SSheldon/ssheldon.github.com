Here's a little something extra for you. I recorded my persuasive speech for English and figured I'd let you listen, too. Aren't I kind? There is a visual that goes along with it, so if you have no idea what I'm talking about at some point that's probably why. Enjoy the speech and feel free to give constructive criticism. I'm not too confident with this speech. It sounds pretty lame when I listen to it, but oh well.
