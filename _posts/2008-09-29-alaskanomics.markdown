I feel left out because Runnan is blogging about politics all the time. So here is political satire! (It's close enough)




Â 




On [an area talk radio show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN_(AM)), there was [a segment where they played a clip from an interview of Sarah Palin and then a clip of Tina Fey imitating her](http://wgnradio.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=44982&Itemid=558). Fey's imitation is, of course, funny, but the interesting part is that they both really say the same thing... nothing at all. Kind of reminded me of [Miss South Carolina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3iNxZ8Dww).
