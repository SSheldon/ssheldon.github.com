Our history book has an interesting habit: it likes to give useless names to people. Usually these names follow a simple pattern: the "______s of the ______". It gets awfully hilarious what they can come up with. Here are some examples:






  * "lords of the loom" - Textile Factory Owners 

  * "lords of the lash" - Slavemasters 

  * "lords of the rail" - Railroad Barons (534) 

  * "Sultans of Steel" - Steel Industrialists (539) 

  * "Napoleon of the Smokestacks" - Andrew Carnegie (539) 

  * "corsairs of finance" - Ruthless Industrialists (540) 

  * "meat kings" - Meat Industrialists (541) 

  * "cigarette czar" - James Buchanan Duke (543) 

  * "steel lords of Pittsburgh" (545) 

  * "Knights of the Saddle" - Cowboys (602) 

  * "sons and daughters of the sod" - Great Plains farmers (610) 

  * "moguls of money" (674) 

  * "sultans of the smokestacks" (674)
