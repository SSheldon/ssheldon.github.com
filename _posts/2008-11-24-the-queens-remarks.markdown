_Identify the purpose of [the queen's remarks](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury) and analyze how she uses the resources of language to achieve her purpose._ 


To the troops gathered at Tilbury in preparation for the expected Spanish invasion, the queen’s appearance must have been remarkable, indeed. This great monarch, rarely seen by the common folk, came down amongst the troops without her usual assortment of bodyguards. She proceeded to give a speech that the troops would be unlikely to forget. The queen’s remarks served the purpose of building confidence and morale in her troops; she did this by telling them of her faith in them, about the righteousness of their cause, and that she was with them. 


The queen’s speech immediately begins by showing her faith in her troops when she refers to them as her “loving people”. While the queen begins her speech using the royal we, it is important to note that she quickly stops using it. This shows a change in her tone from stiff and formal to casual and informal, making her seem comfortable and trusting around her troops. To further show the troops of her trust for them, in lines 2-5 she talks of how she came before her armed subjects even against the wishes of some of her advisors. Additionally, throughout the speech the queen chooses words to describe her subjects that are meant to prove her faith in the troops; this is noticeable when she refers to the, “loyal hears and good-will of my subjects,” (7-8). Finally, if any particularly thick soldier is still unaware that she trusts her troops, in lines 25-27 she says, “not doubting but by your obedience to my general, by your concord in my camp, and your valor in the field…” 


With her troops firmly aware that she is confident in them, the queen is also working to convince the troops that their cause is righteous. She first attempts this by alluding to her enemies as “tyrants” and insinuating that God is on her side in lines 5-6. Later, Queen Elizabeth says, “[I] think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm,” (15-17). This statement not only appeals to the troops’ patriotism, but it also conjures images of strange, foreign countries to which the troops will recoil at the thought of. Finally, at the closing of her speech, Elizabeth talks of, “those enemies of my god, of my kingdom, and of my people,” (27-28). By saying this, Elizabeth is telling her troops that these enemies they are about to face are not merely her enemies; they are their enemies, too, and even their God’s enemies. 


The last major tactic the queen uses to boost her troops’ confidence is numerous references to the fact that she is there with her troops. This is first apparent in the previously discussed lines 2-5; here she makes the point that she is with her troops and punctuates it by saying that some of her advisors even advised against it. Additionally, the queen talks of how she has come to live and die among her troops and that she will lay her life down for her kingdom and her people (8-13). This statement is very important, because it shows her troops how far she is willing to go for this cause and therefore motivates them to do the same. Lastly, in lines 17-20, she again refers to the fact that she is with the troops by saying that she herself would take up arms before she allowed her kingdom to be invaded. 


Seeing how Elizabeth talked of her faith in her troops, convinced them of her confidence in them, and made a point of showing them that she was there with them, it is apparent that her remarks served the purpose of building confidence and morale in her troops. And these troops would need all the confidence that they could get if they were to stand up to the approaching Spanish army. Fortunately for these troops, the expected enemies never arrived.
