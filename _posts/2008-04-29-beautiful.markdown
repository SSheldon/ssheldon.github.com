The [new xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/417/) is beautiful. It conjures up emotions from deep inside one. Read the comic and try not to be moved! Imagine, if you will, the lonely, tough, world-hardened man, facing his life alone yet still content. He finds love, for a brief fleeting time. All the while, though, he streaks across barren and lonely landscapes against his will. However, one day his child is born, and she sets out, unintentionally, in her fathers footsteps, never even meeting her mother. She will lead her own free life, unbound by the conventional laws, unbridled by society, untouched by the laws of physics. It brings a tear to my eye.
