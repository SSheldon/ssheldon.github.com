The next version of [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is packed full of
[awesome improvements](https://gist.github.com/imathis/e9c2ee2406e93c4269e8).
Octopress will change massively to be more extensible and customizable while
still being as powerful and easy as ever; as such, this update has been in
development for a long time, still not having released officially.

In anticipation of this update, I periodically check the
[Octopress Twitter](https://twitter.com/octopress) for news and have
encountered many release date estimates. Estimating time for development is
[notoriously difficult](http://blog.hut8labs.com/coding-fast-and-slow.html),
so I've compiled a lighthearted Twitter history of Octopress 2.0's
successor and its estimated release dates.

<!-- more -->

The follow-up to Octopress 2.0 was originally envisioned as a much smaller set
of changes to be called Octopress 2.1. The release of this version was first
mentioned in March of 2012 as "soon".

{% tweet 184723922556686337 hide_thread=true %}

By May, the outlook for Octopress 2.1 was looking good enough that its release
seemed imminent, within a "day or two".

{% tweet 205288498591309824 hide_thread=true %}

But it was not to be! A week and a half later, in June, 2.1 was still looking
as though it would release "soon".

{% tweet 209408163571707905 hide_thread=true %}

Next month, July, enough progress had been made to offer a new estimate that
2.1 would release in a "week or two".

{% tweet 219804276447379456 %}

It was not until 4 months later in November that the next estimation was made
that 2.1 would be released before the end of 2012.

{% tweet 268762061197148161 %}

With an acknowledgement of the difficulty in estimating, by January 2013
Octopress 2.1 was predicted to be completed "soon".

{% tweet 289446177575948289 %}

In February, it seemed that the eagerly awaited update would be finalized
within a "month or two".

{% tweet 300027017397665793 %}

With the tremendous amount of effort that had gone into the update, it seemed
more fitting that the major version change, so it would instead be released as
[Octopress 3.0](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/306972342582657026).

By March, this 3.0 update's release date was further clarified to "mid April".

{% tweet 314553072535887872 %}

My mid April, though, it seemed more likely that the release would occur
later in the month.

{% tweet 323868125709864960 %}

Although an April release had been missed, by late May it seemed that there
would be a 3.0 release candidate available within a "month or so".

{% tweet 339044122801360896 %}

At the end of June, the ambitious Octopress 3.0 was still predicted to arrive
during the summer.

{% tweet 351439257996505088 %}

And so we still anticipate the official release of this update that will
redefine Octopress. This does showcase a neat benefit of open source;
despite not being officilly released, you can try out 3.0 and closely follow
its development [on GitHub](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/tree/2.1).

Regardless of Octopress' history of imprecise estimates, I have great faith in
its developers to deliver such an ambitious update. I'll keep an eye out on
Twitter for an announcement that Octopress 3.0 has finally been perfected!

**Update (Aug 18, 2013):**
By the end of July, there was still "a ways to go" on Octopress 3.0, but
version 2.1 of Octopress was resurrected as a smaller, incremental upgrade on
the way to Octopress 3.0.

{% tweet 361299670313615360 %}

**Update (Feb 15, 2014):**
In September, Octopress 3.0 still wasn't ready for release, but it seemed
mature enough that a blog post was promised detailing the roadmap leading up
to its release.

{% tweet 375377966727192576 %}

Despite it originally being anticipated that this blog post would be published
[within a week](https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/381781655385812992),
by mid October there were still details to be ironed out.

{% tweet 392425128442994688 %}

By the new year, it appeared that version 3.0 was still "a couple of months"
away from being released.

{% tweet 420592959672029184 %}

It also appears that the previously proposed version 2.1 was abandoned,
so no new version is slated before Octopress 3.0.
