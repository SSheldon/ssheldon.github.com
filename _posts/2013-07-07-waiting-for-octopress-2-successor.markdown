The next version of [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is packed full of
[awesome improvements](https://gist.github.com/imathis/e9c2ee2406e93c4269e8).
Octopress will change massively to be more extensible and customizable while
still being as powerful and easy as ever; as such, this update has been in
development for a long time, still not having released officially.

In anticipation of this update, I periodically check the
[Octopress Twitter](https://twitter.com/octopress) for news and have
encountered many release date estimates. Estimating time for development is
[notoriously difficult](http://blog.hut8labs.com/coding-fast-and-slow.html),
so I've compiled a lighthearted Twitter history of Octopress 2.0's
successor and its estimated release dates.

<!-- more -->

The follow-up to Octopress 2.0 was originally envisioned as a much smaller set
of changes to be called Octopress 2.1. The release of this version was first
mentioned in March of 2012 as "soon".

> That will be shipping in 2.1 (soon).
>
> — @octopress [March 27, 2012](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/184723922556686337)

By May, the outlook for Octopress 2.1 was looking good enough that its release
seemed imminent, within a "day or two".

> Have you tried 2.1 yet? I'm hoping to release it in the next day or two.
>
> — @octopress [May 23, 2012](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/205288498591309824)

But it was not to be! A week and a half later, in June, 2.1 was still looking
as though it would release "soon".

> 2.1 should be releasing soon. It has lots of goodies and fixes.
>
> — @octopress [June 3, 2012](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/209408163571707905)

Next month, July, enough progress had been made to offer a new estimate that
2.1 would release in a "week or two".

> It'll be released once I finish a couple of remaining features. I'm hoping that'll be in the next week or two.
>
> — @octopress [July 2, 2012](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/219804276447379456)

It was not until 4 months later in November that the next estimation was made
that 2.1 would be released before the end of 2012.

> I can’t give a solid date right now. But I expect to have a release before years end.
>
> — @octopress [November 14, 2012](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/268762061197148161)

With an acknowledgement of the difficulty in estimating, by January 2013
Octopress 2.1 was predicted to be completed "soon".

> We're working on an asset pipeline, fixing any critical bugs and setting up a migration for 2.0. It's hard to estimate, but soon.
>
> — @octopress [January 10, 2013](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/289446177575948289)

In February, it seemed that the eagerly awaited update would be finalized
within a "month or two".

> right now [the 2.1 branch is] not entirely stable. We’re working on a few large features then we’ll release it in the next month or two.
>
> — @octopress [February 8, 2013](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/300027017397665793)

With the tremendous amount of effort that had gone into the update, it seemed
more fitting that the major version change, so it would instead be released as
[Octopress 3.0](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/306972342582657026).

By March, this 3.0 update's release date was further clarified to "mid April".

> Right now, 2.1 is under pretty active development. We’re shooting for a mid April release, so it might be a good idea to wait.
>
> — @octopress [March 20, 2013](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/314553072535887872)

My mid April, though, it seemed more likely that the release would occur
later in the month.

> [The next release is] in flux right now. We’re hoping for late April.
>
> — @octopress [April 15, 2013](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/323868125709864960)

Although an April release had been missed, by late May it seemed that there
would be a 3.0 release candidate available within a "month or so".

> We’re currently working through getting some core functionality working, but I’ll be announcing an RC in the next month or so.
>
> — @octopress [May 27, 2013](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/339044122801360896)

At the end of June, the ambitious Octopress 3.0 was still predicted to arrive
during the summer.

> [3.0 is] Going well. We’re targeting a summer release, still lots to do though. :)
>
> — @octopress [June 30, 2013](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/351439257996505088)

And so we still anticipate the official release of this update that will
redefine Octopress. This does showcase a neat benefit of open source;
despite not being officilly released, you can try out 3.0 and closely follow
its development [on GitHub](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/tree/2.1).

Regardless of Octopress' history of imprecise estimates, I have great faith in
its developers to deliver such an ambitious update. I'll keep an eye out on
Twitter for an announcement that Octopress 3.0 has finally been perfected!

**Update (Aug 18, 2013):**
By the end of July, there was still "a ways to go" on Octopress 3.0, but
version 2.1 of Octopress was resurrected as a smaller, incremental upgrade on
the way to Octopress 3.0.

> we still have a ways to go. Right now I’m working on 2.1 which adds support for Jekyll 1.0 and uses Guard for watching files.

**Update (Feb 15, 2014):**
In September, Octopress 3.0 still wasn't ready for release, but it seemed
mature enough that a blog post was promised detailing the roadmap leading up
to its release.

> We’ve finally nailed it down. Blog post coming soon after @imathis gets back from BlendConf.
>
> — @octopress [September 4, 2013](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/375377966727192576)

Despite it originally being anticipated that this blog post would be published
[within a week](https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/381781655385812992),
by mid October there were still details to be ironed out.

> There’s a draft. Still ironing out some details. :)
>
> — @octopress [October 21, 2013](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/392425128442994688)

By the new year, it appeared that version 3.0 was still "a couple of months"
away from being released.

> The update is coming with Octopress 3.0 (which is probably a couple of months out) you should be able to migrate content easily.
>
> — @octopress [January 7, 2014](https://twitter.com/octopress/status/420592959672029184)

It also appears that the previously proposed version 2.1 was abandoned,
so no new version is slated before Octopress 3.0.
