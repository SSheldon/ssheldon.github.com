I feel like talking about video games. Listen:






  * [Dead Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_(video_game)) came out a week ago, and [it's been getting some good reviews](http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/deadspace?q=Dead Space). I'm picking that up; horror in video games? Good! Horror in movies? Lame! 

  * [Star Wars: The Old Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic) [was announced a couple days ago](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/10/21/star-wars-the-old-republic-mmo-unveiled/). Hopefully it won't take too long [to get from PC to Xbox](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/10/22/star-wars-the-old-republic-under-consideration-for-consoles/). 

  * [The 20 free songs with Rock Band 2 were announced](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/10/22/rock-band-2-free-dlc-is-indie-tastic/). Lots o' people are pissed off with the lack of really popular bands. I'm cool with it; I've heard of some of them but it should be a good way to learn of some new music. 

  * [The NXE is coming November 19](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/10/08/tgs-08-new-xbox-experience-releases-november-19/). Am I excited? I still don't know. 

  * [Fable II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable_II)'s reviews are looking good. Guess I'll have to pick that up... 

  * I convinced Greg to want [Too Human](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Human). Free game for me! 

  * I still don't know if I will be getting [Fallout 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3). I do like RPGs, but [Morrowind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind) was boring... 

  * [Left 4 Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead) (11/18) and [Gears of War 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War_2) (11/07) still look frickin' sweet. 

  * [Halo: The Cole Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_The_Cole_Protocol) is coming out. Guess I'll finally have to read a book again... Being a hardcore nerd is difficult.

  * [Portal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)): [Still Alive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)#Portal:_Still_Alive) [dropped today](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/10/22/portal-still-alive-teleports-to-the-xbla/). All my Xbox 360 owning friends who don't own [The Orange Box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Box)? Buy this. Now!
