I learned how to use [TourtiseSVN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TortoiseSVN) today to do [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) commits. It's pretty nifty. I... I don't know why I'm telling you this. Maybe I want a pat on the back? Why am I so desperately seeking approval from strangers? Apparently I have personal issues to go work out...

P.S.: The more I use it, the more and more I like [CodePlex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodePlex). Go [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)!

P.P.S.: The more you say source, the more it starts to sound like a corruption of sauce. Hehe.
