title: "Objective-C from Rust: Statically Verified Type Encodings without Allocation"

Lately I've been thinking about a new way to generate
[Objective-C type encodings](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html)
from Rust. The Objective-C runtime needs these encodings when declaring methods
and instance variables, and in Objective-C they're simply generated via the
`@encode()` compiler directive, but that's not available in Rust!

<!-- more -->

The current approach used in the `objc` crate basically just treats them as
strings, like they are in Objective-C. The intention was: when you want the
encoding of a type, just go run the Objective-C compiler and copy the result of
`@encode()`.

However, the encoding for a type is not the same on all platforms;
certain types have different encodings on different architectures.
`@encode(NSInteger)` is `"i"` on 32-bit systems and `"q"` on 64-bit systems,
while `@encode(BOOL)` is `"c"` on most platforms but `"b"` on ARM64.

With these discrepancies, it's really convenient to have ways of building up
a type encoding from its parts. A first approach could look something like:

{% raw %}
``` rust
fn encode_struct(name: &str, fields: &[&str]) -> String {
    let mut encoding = format!("{{{}=", name);
    encoding.extend(fields.iter().cloned());
    encoding.push('}');
    encoding
}

encode_struct("CGPoint", &[GCFloat::encode(), CGFloat::encode()])
```
{% endraw %}

This makes it easier for us to generate the struct's encoding and
use the appropriate encoding for `CGFloat` on our platform.
However, it's a [stringly-typed API](http://wiki.c2.com/?StringlyTyped);
encodings have a well-defined format, but this code accepts inputs that can
make it produce invalid encodings, like:

``` rust
encode_struct("CGPoint", &["Hello, World!"])
```

Can we do better? Is there a design that will allow us to say
"I accept valid encodings and will produce a valid encoding from them"?

## Abstract syntax

Looking at the documentation for encodings, we can see that their grammar is
pretty simple. It's not hard to represent the abstract syntax with Rust's enums:

``` rust
enum Encoding {
    Char,
    Int,
    ...
    Pointer(Box<Encoding>),
    Struct(String, Vec<Encoding>),
    ...
}
```

With this, it's even easier to build the encoding of a struct from its parts,
because the type system won't let you build a struct encoding with an
invalid format!

There's something I'm curious if we can improve on, though: see `Box` and `Vec`
in that definition? Each of those will involve a memory allocation.
Representing as simple an encoding as `"^i"` will allocate additional memory,
and complex encodings like `"{CGRect={CGPoint=dd}{CGSize=dd}}"` require more.

## Zero allocation

Our new challenge is composing these encodings together without allocation or
virtualization. That problem reminds me of the design of
[iterators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html) and
[futures](https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/) in Rust;
rather than representing these as a single concrete type, there is a trait
defining the core functionality and then iterators/futures can be combined
through generic structs which also conform to the trait.

Let's take some inspiration from this design and say that there is an `Encoding`
trait which every type representing a valid encoding implements
(we'll come back later to exactly what functionality it should expose).
Modelling a pointer encoding can be as simple as:

``` rust
// T is the type of the target's encoding
struct Pointer<T: Encoding>(T);
```

Simple, and it avoids allocating!

Things get trickier when we want to model a struct, because we need to hold the
encoding of its multiple fields which may be of differing types.
My go-to solution for representing heterogenous collections is using tuples
with a trait they implement exposing the functionality we need, like the
[`MessageArguments` trait in the `objc` crate]({% post_url 2015-08-02-objective-c-from-rust-objc_msgsend %}).
With such a trait, we could be able to create struct encodings like:

``` rust
Struct { name: "MyStruct", fields: (Float, Pointer(Int)) }
```

Again, no allocations needed. But what functionality will be needed in our
encoding-tuple trait?

## Encodings trait

In the end, the functionality we'll need from encodings will include
writing out their string representation and comparing them for equality.
For a struct encoding to do this, it will need access to its fields.
If we could iterate over the fields of the struct, that should be sufficient!

Unfortunately, we can't create an `Iterator` in this case; what would be the
type of the items it yields? As mentioned earlier, we're working with tuples
that contain encodings of differing types, so there is no single type we could
choose for the type of the iterator's items.

There's a different iteration technique we can fall back to:
[internal iteration](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/01/13/iteration-inside-and-out/).
Internal (or push-based) iteration differs from external (or pull-based)
iteration in that, instead of asking for each next element and then doing
something with it, you provide an action to perform and that action is called
for each item in the collection.

Internal iteration works for us because, instead of needing to say explicitly
which type of item will be returned, we can just ask for an action that can be
performed on any type that implements `Encoding`!

There's one obstacle here: we can't use Rust's usual `Fn` types because when
the closure is passed, we don't know exactly which type of encoding it will be
called with. In fact, we expect it to be called with different types of encoding!
In effect, we want a closure that hasn't yet been monomorphized,
which doesn't appear to be possible.
If it were, the declaration would look something like this:

``` rust
trait Encodings {
    fn each<F>(&self: callback: F) where for<T: Encode> F: FnMut(T) -> bool;
}
```

But instead we settle for defining the callback as a custom trait:

``` rust
pub trait EncodingsIterateCallback {
    fn call<T: Encoding>(&mut self, &T) -> bool;
}

trait Encodings {
    fn each<F: EncodingsIterateCallback>(&self: callback: F);
}
```

And voilÃ ! Now we have a way to iterate over a heterogenous collection of
encodings. We can implement this trait for encodings of tuples and be on our way.

## Encoding trait

You may have noticed that we've so far dodged an important question:
what does the `Encoding` trait look like? Let's figure that out!

As mentioned earlier, one of the things we'll want to do with encodings is
compare them for equality. But how can we compare with an encoding that could
be any type? The `Encoding` trait will need to provide some sort of
"common language" through which encodings of different types can interoperate.

Fortunately, the kinds of encodings that exist are constrained and well-known.
We would be able to compare if we could ask encodings something like:
are you a pointer? what's the encoding of your target? are you an array?
what's your length?

To solve this, I used a `Descriptor` enum that describes which kind an encoding
is and provides its properties. In pseudo-Rust, it looks like:

``` rust
enum Descriptor {
    // Primitive is an enum of all encodings not composed from others
    Primitive(Primitive),
    Pointer(&(impl Encoding)),
    Array(u32, &(impl Encoding)),
    Struct(&str, &(impl Encodings)),
    Union(&str, &(impl Encodings)),
}
```

The [real implementation](https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc-encode/blob/0.0.2/src/descriptor.rs)
looks gnarlier and is generic rather than using `impl Trait`, but it's the same
idea.

With this descriptor we are effectively able to "downcast" encodings and figure
out more about them, allowing us to compare encodings or convert them to strings.
The `Encoding` trait ultimately ends up looking like:

``` rust
pub trait Encoding {
    type PointerTarget: ?Sized + Encoding;
    type ArrayItem: ?Sized + Encoding;
    type StructFields: ?Sized + Encodings;
    type UnionMembers: ?Sized + Encodings;

    fn descriptor(&self) -> Descriptor<Self::PointerTarget,
                                       Self::ArrayItem,
                                       Self::StructFields,
                                       Self::UnionMembers>;

    fn eq_encoding<T: ?Sized + Encoding>(&self, other: &T) -> bool {
        /* implementation provided based on the descriptor */
    }

    fn write<W: fmt::Write>(&self, writer: &mut W) -> fmt::Result {
        /* implementation provided based on the descriptor */
    }
}
```

## Parsing encodings

As cool as the encoding structs we've made so far are, we can't build encodings
like them from parsing a string. This is because at compile time we have know
idea how big the result would be, and with monomorphization the compiler would
have to generate code for creating every possible kind of encoding struct,
and there are infinitely many possible encodings. Believe me, I tried:

![](/blog/images/objective-c-from-rust-type-encodings/recursion-limit.png)

What we can do, though, is make a new kind of encoding that is initialized from
a string and parses itself lazily; I ended up calling
[this type `StrEncoding`](https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc-encode/blob/0.0.2/src/parse/encoding.rs).
When `StrEncoding`'s `descriptor` method is called, it determines which kind of
encoding it is and creates more `StrEncoding`s for any sub-encodings it contains.
These sub-encodings reference safely into the original buffer,
no copying required, thanks to Rust's lifetimes and ownership system.

There is one gotcha: our `Encoding` trait was designed for structs with
encodings inside them, and so was designed where references to the contained
encodings are returned. This doesn't seem to work with `StrEncoding`;
it doesn't own its sub-encodings (remember, it creates them on demand),
and how could we return a reference to something that was created inside the
method and is about to drop out of scope?

The key to solving this was realizing that the `StrEncoding` doesn't actually
need any data other than its input string. What if we were able to convert
a reference to a `str` into a reference to a `StrEncoding`?
Turns out this is possible if `StrEncoding` is defined as a
[dynamically-sized type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#dynamically-sized-types-dsts)
wrapping `str`:

``` rust
struct StrEncoding(str);
```

And with that, when a `StrEncoding` is parsed, it is able to return references
to sub-encodings with the same lifetime!

## Owned StrEncoding

As nice as our dynamically sized `StrEncoding` is, sometimes it'd be beneficial
to have a parsed encoding which owns its buffer and can be passed around
without worrying about lifetimes.

Complicating this is the fact that I was aiming to have this encodings crate be
[`no_std`, relying only on libcore](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/using-rust-without-the-standard-library.html).
`String` doesn't even exist in libcore! How can we make a parsed encoding
which owns a `String` when it's not available?

Since we can't access `String` ourselves, I figured we'd have to use a generic
type parameter through which users could specify that `String` is used.
I scoured the docs for a trait that is implemented by `String` and accessible
in libcore and found just what we need in `AsRef<str>`.

A further bonus is that `str` itself implements `AsRef<str>`,
so we don't actually even need a new type for this;
we can modify `StrEncoding` to support its original use case and this new one:

``` rust
struct StrEncoding<S = str>(S) where S: ?Sized + AsRef<str>;
```

Now we can have multiple flavors of string encodings:
the original, dynamically sized version as `&StrEncoding<str>`,
or one with an owned buffer as `StrEncoding<String>`.

## The end result

I've published the end result as
[the `objc-encode` crate](https://crates.io/crates/objc-encode),
which allows creating encodings that are statically known to be valid
and can be compared against encodings parsed from a string representation,
all without memory allocation.

[The encodings compose well](https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc-encode/blob/0.0.2/examples/core_graphics.rs#L41-L53),
albeit with a bit of boilerplate for more complex structs.
The good news is that this boilerplate is very formulaic, and I think generating
it would be a great candidate for a
[custom derive macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/procedural-macros.html),
something I'm eager to try in the future!
