I am confirmed! We traveled to Marian in the morning and I joined a massive group of confirmands. We were to be confirmed in a gym, of all places. This is to be a holy sacrament of a two thousand year old church... and it is taking place in a high school gym? Now I'm not a very religous person, but one thing I like about my faith is the sense of stability and security you get from taking part in time-honored rituals from centuries past. I don't want my religion to change with the times; I don't agree with the church on a lot of things and I immediately don't take what it says as truth, but I don't want the church to change its values as time goes by. I guess that I'm saying that I don't like my faith because of the things it tells me, because I disagree at times, but rather because of the comfort and security it offers me. There was [an excellent essay written in Time](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1645160,00.html) that I can agree with. But, back to the point, performing this sacred act in a school gym seemed to take the sanctity out of it. Oh well. Anyways, things went without a hitch, they smeared some stuff on my forehead that smelled piney, and all was well. I got a gift from my prayer partner, who also happens to be my priest, and this surprised and delighted me greatly.

Afterwards, my family and I went back to my house for a "party". Everyone seemed tired, but it was nice to get to talk to family members and chill out. The only one of my friends who could come was Marius. We had Italian Beef sandwiches from Portillo's. They were great, and I ended up eating like 4. I got some nice things from my family: a rosewood pen from my aunt, a rosewood box and $20 from my uncle, and a necklace from my grandma. All in all it was a pleasant experience, and being confirmed is pretty cool, I guess.
