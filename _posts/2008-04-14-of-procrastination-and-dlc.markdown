I can't have a day without an update! Only problem is that I don't really have anything to talk about...

So I had one assignment for homework tonight and I still haven't started it. It's a project. I'm screwed. I hate my procrasination.

Scouts was lame tonight. Marius and I just studied for the test in English tomorrow.

Tomorrow is Legendary map pack day! I'm excited. It's also Rock Band DLC day, and I think I'll be getting "[Message in a Bottle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_in_a_Bottle_(song%29)". Will update tomorrow!
