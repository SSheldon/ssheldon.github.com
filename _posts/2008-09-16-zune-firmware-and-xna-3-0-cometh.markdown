The [Zune 3.0 firmware](http://zuneinsider.com/archive/2008/09/08/yep-we-re-doing-those-things.aspx) [dropped today](http://gotzune.com/2008/09/zune-30-is-here); it was quite a while ago [when 2.5 dropped]({% post_url 2008-05-08-zune-update %}). The new features are pretty impressive, but they aren't ones I see myself using much. The biggest update is that you can now buy songs from the Zune. This is something that people who criticize Zunes have been bitching about for a long time, so it's a nice feature to see. I don't use the Zune Marketplace, so it isn't that big for me. Songs you listen to on the radio will be linked to their metadata online so you can flag them for download and whatnot. With the ability to connect to the Marketplace over wifi they apparently took wifi more seriously and worked out some of the kinks, seeing as I can now (finally) wirelessly sync with my computer. They added channels, which are just a bunch of related songs; you can subscribe to a channel and have it download the songs for you. This isn't useful if you don't have a Zune Pass unless you want to buy all the songs the channel suggests.

I'm pretty out of the loop, but I just learned that [the XNA Game Studio 3.0 Beta will be available soon](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2008/09/12/xna-game-studio-3-0-beta-release-on-its-way.aspx). The Zune 3.0 firmware supports the XNA Game Studio 3.0 Beta, and, although no one told me, [it does not support the XNA Game Studio 3.0 CTP](http://klucher.com/archive/2008/09/13/xna-game-studio-3-0-ctp-and-zune-3-0.aspx), which means that all the games I currently have on my Zune (including [my very own Zune Minesweeper](http://www.codeplex.com/zuneminesweeper)) no longer work. It isn't too bad, though; when the 3.0 Beta comes out we'll be able to [take screenshots of Zune games](http://klucher.com/archive/2008/09/15/new-xna-game-studio-feature-screen-capture.aspx) and [call up a Zune system media control](http://klucher.com/archive/2008/09/14/new-xna-game-studio-feature-zune-system-media-control.aspx). This is great news for me, because it means I don't actually have to work and develop my own music interface; yay laziness!

Also, to pick a fight: [iPod touch 2.1 firmware update now available](http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/09/ipod-touch-2-1-firmware-update-now-available/)... 'cept it's $10. Heh.
