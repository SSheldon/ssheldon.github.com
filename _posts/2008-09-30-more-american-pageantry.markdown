So, it's three in the morning, and I am so sick and tired of History. I know! I'll mock my history book!




Â 




_**Chapter 9**_






  * "People do not chop off heads so readily when they can chop down trees." 

  * "But the poorer states' rights people pooh-poohed the talk of anarchy."



_**Chapter 8**_






  * "To say that America, with some French aid, defeated Britain is like saying, 'Daddy and I killed the bear.'"



Seriously. I'm not making these things up...
