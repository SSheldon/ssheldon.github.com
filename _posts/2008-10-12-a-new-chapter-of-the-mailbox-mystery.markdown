Among other people, Michael and Taylor have also gotten coloring book pages.




 




Up to snuff now? Good. So I'm taking a nap today (because I was supposed to be doing math) and suddenly my dad comes in and tells me to come downstairs because, "there are people here to see me." I'm confused and in my pajamas, but I'm walking down the stairs when I see two pairs of black shoes... attached to black pants... wearing belts... with guns! So there are cops in my house. Awesome. I'm totally confused now, and also a tad scared.




 




So anyways, turns out whoever is giving these things to people was trying to give me a little kid's book about God that they had scribbled in and written rude things. They looked my last name up in the phonebook but found the wrong family and put it in their mailbox. This other family, not having a son to understand this prank, was incensed and called the cops. The cops, trying to figure out what this was all about, came and tracked me down. And they got to talk to me in my flannel pants and Xbox 360 shirt. Nice, right?




 




I'd love to show you guys pictures of the book, but I didn't even get to see it. The cops took it, so sorry.




 




This still leaves one unanswered question, though: Who the hell is doing this? They apparently don't know where I live, so... that doesn't really narrow it down. Oh well. It remains a mystery yet.
