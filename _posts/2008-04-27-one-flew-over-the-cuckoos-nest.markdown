Well, I told you that [we finished the movie](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/of-lobotomies-and-grammar/). Now we're starting [the book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo's_Nest_(novel)).

We're really digging into it. 100 pages for the first assignment. It sucks. I have to read a lot every night. For tomorrow night I've got 42 pages to read! This is insane. Freakin' student teachers. The book started off pretty horribly. Nothing makes sense. I can never tell if what's going on is present, a flashback, or something imaginary. It's really confusing and tedious. It finally picked up when McMurphy shpwed up because there was more dialog and less rambling by the chief. The book seems pretty depressing because we already know what is going to happen, so there isn't much incentive to keep reading.
