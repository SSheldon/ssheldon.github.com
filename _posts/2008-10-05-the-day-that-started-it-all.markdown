So, today was my birthday. But wait! Before we can talk about that, we need to go back in time a little bit... to Friday lunch, say. At this time, I was given some wonderful birthday brownies baked by the culinary expert that is [Mary](http://theocake.blogspot.com/) (under [Red](http://lessgravity.blogspot.com/)'s command, of course). I have pictures of said brownies.

Anyways, on to the actual birthday. It began as well as any good day: with a good breakfast.

It kind of just went down hill from there. There were no presents because I took to long to make up my mind or the things I want aren't available now. I spent a lot of my day doing homework because this weekend has been so action packed. Yeah. I'd talk about more of my birthday, but I didn't really do anything... oh well. There was cake. It was eaten in jammies. Of course. Next weekend I should have a party. I'll get to work on that.
