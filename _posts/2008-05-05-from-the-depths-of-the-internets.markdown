So I'm taking some things off my website, but since I liked 'em so much I figured I'd put them up on my blog. If you've seen these things, they're good for a nostalgic laugh, and if you haven't then I hope you enjoy them! Oh, I also made a new category called "[From the Internets](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/category/from-the-internets/)" for all the funny stuff I want to link to from here. Enjoy!

Oh, and also: [Cogito, ergo edo](http://www.ealasaid.com/quotes/latinsil.html). (For the lazy people out there, that means "I think, therefore I eat")
