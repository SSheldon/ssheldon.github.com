Sometimes I think naming a post is the hardest part. A name means that the post has a purpose and a topic. Unfortunately, that isn't really the case here. I'm just kind of rambling and seeing where my thoughts will go.




 




New theme, eh? I don't care if you don't like it, it matches my website. The dark colors are soothing.




 




Rock Band is still amazing. I'm waiting for this game to get old but it just won't. My current addiction is the Band World Tour, although I still need to beat Vocals on Hard. I'd really like to beat the Endless Setlist, but my bandmate needs to stop dragging her feet. Uy, co-op is indeed my bane. I don't think I'll ever be able to beat the Drums on Hard. The Boston songs still kick ass though. I'd kill to get some System of a Down on Rock Band! The song "Soil" has good drum and guitar parts, but there is a repeated theme of using a word that accuses the recipient of relations with their mother which kind of makes it unlikely that the song will make it into this T game.




 




After finishing this post making a title isn't so hard. Perhaps I should always do things in reverse order. Expect to see me attending classes in reverse order and doing homework before it is assigned. What a strange world.
