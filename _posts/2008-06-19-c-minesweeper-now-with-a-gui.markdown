I finished it! At least, I think I'm done. This is my preparation for making an XNA Minesweeper, which I will then get for my Zune! It's all an elaborate plot! Anyways, give C# Minesweeper a try if you have the .NET Framework. It's as near to an exact rip-off of the real Minesweeper as I could get. I could probably get sued for this. Oh well. Give it a try!
