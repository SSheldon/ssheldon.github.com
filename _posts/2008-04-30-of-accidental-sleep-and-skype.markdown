Today wasn't too bad. In the wee hours of the morning, at a time I still consider night time, I was supposed to wake up and take some food from the crock pot that my mom was cooking. I had an alarm set and everything in case I fell asleep. And I did fall asleep. I fell asleep atop my homework with my light on, and I was out so deeply that I instinctively turned the alarm off once it began sounding. I didn't awake until an hour later, when I panicked and ran to take care of my chore. Fortunately, things apparently don't overcook very easily in a crock pot, so I was off the hook.

When school came around, we had a reading day in English, so I was able to finish the night's homework. I was content in Spanish because I was working on IPA for a lot of the time. I had lunch, and then proceeded to crash. It was terrible. I had trouble staying awake in Chemistry, Math was harder, and by the time I was in Intro I couldn't take it. I kept falling asleep in Intro, realizing I was supposed to have written something, and then frantically scribbling something down while falling asleep again. Forutnately, today didn't really require attention (wait, is that different from any other day?). We started softball in gym, which I'm no good at, but oh well.

After school I mostly worked on homework, [Skyping](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/skyping/), and [editing together a podcast](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/tatercast-01-featuring-runnan-podcast/). Be sure to check out the fruits of my labor!
