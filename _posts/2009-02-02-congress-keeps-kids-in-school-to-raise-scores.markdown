WASHINGTON—In light of the continued decline of American students’ test scores in comparison to the rest of the world, Congress today passed a bill requiring students to spend at least 10 hours at school on school days. 


After relatively brief discussion, it was determined that American students are falling behind because they are lazy and not trying hard enough. Legislators hope to alleviate this problem by keeping kids at school longer, ensuring that they will get more done and learn more. 


“This decline in test scores obviously shows that school is not a big enough part of kids’ lives these days. Maybe if students did more outside of school instead of the bare minimum, the measures we are taking today wouldn’t be necessary,” said Representative Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania. 


A special research committee had previously been formed to examine the best solution for the situation, but when reports started coming in about the complexity of the issue and the word “reform” was uttered, the committee was disbanded. “I don’t know why we wasted our time with that committee when the problem was so readily apparent,” Representative Vernon Ehlers of Michigan said. 


“The fact is, American children have become lazy. They don’t know the value of hard work any more. They’ve become out of touch with the real world,” said Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, as he joined his chauffer to be driven to lunch with a lobbyist. 


According to Congressmen, this bill will help our children “beat those foreign nerds”. While the issue of the growing disparity between American test scores and the rest of the developed world has many concerned, Congressmen took solace knowing that “our football teams can beat theirs.” 


As Representative Brett Guthrie of Kentucky explained it, “This bill is all about the children. We just want what’s best for the children, and in this case we need to help them reach a better future. I voted for this bill because I care about the children. In fact, I have children of my own! My opponent in the upcoming election, on the other hand…” 


“If things get too bad,” one Senator pointed out, “These countries could start using their students to create new weapons of mass destruction! We would have no choice but to intervene!” 


Critics of the bill argued that this emphasis on test scores and the proposed longer days would stifle creativity in students, until they were appeased by the inclusion of a clause stating that students must spend one hour of each school day finger painting. 


Progress on the bill, while rapid, was briefly delayed when a group of libertarians rushed into the chamber to protest public education, which they declared unconstitutional because it is supported by tax dollars. 


The bill was completed with a strong showing of bipartisan effort. After it was passed, a recess was unanimously called for, but Republicans and Democrats spent the next two hours arguing over its length.
