[Yes, indeed, the war is on](http://ponspk.blogspot.com/2008/04/wat.html). But who is more foolish? The fool, or he who follows the fool?

So, as you can probably tell, I've chosen Live Spaces to host my blog. Whatever, eh? I was regretting my decision today when Windows Live started telling me I couldn't update my blog at the time. Well that's just great, in'it?

Parametrics are no fun. Polar equations could be interesting enough though. I've got a polar graph paper on my skydrive in case anyone in Precalc wants it. Here's a link:

'Spose I should work on homework now as opposed to in the middle of the night. Where's the fun in that though?
