So, [Ikaruga is coming to XBLA this Wednesday](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/04/07/confirmed-ikaruga-to-the-xbla-this-wednesday/). [It got an 85 on Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/cube/ikaruga?q=Ikaruga), which is a damn good score for a $10 game. I'm not sure whether I'll buy it. I haven't played many bullet hell games, but it sounds like a good game. I've got no idea, so I'll pretend like people read this blog and ask for comments! Help me out, imaginary readers!
