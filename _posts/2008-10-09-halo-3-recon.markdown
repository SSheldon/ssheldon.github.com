So, lots of the details have been spilt on [Halo 3: Recon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_3:_Recon) (that's the official name of the game that [the teaser trailer](http://couchpotato99.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!BF9CFC6F077AD90A!623.entry) was about). Turns out it isn't a campaign expansion. No, this is a brand new game.

I take issue with the name of the game. Why is it called Halo **_3_**: Recon? Why not just Halo: Recon? It's all just to piggyback on Halo 3's popularity. Anyways, it is most definitely not an expansion, but rather a whole new Halo game. Yay! It'll be here in Fall '09, so I've still got a year to wait. Along with the announcement of the game came an extended version of the teaser trailer that was previously released; now it can actually be called a trailer. Here it is for your viewing pleasure:

In other news, [the flood have been confirmed to be playable in Halo Wars](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/10/09/tgs-08-halo-wars-in-early-09-flood-confirmed/) ([video](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/10/09/video-halo-wars-demo-with-the-flood/)). I'm also excited for that game. Oh, and Gears of War 2 is making me remember good times from Gears' campaign. I can't wait for that, either. Yikes, being a gamer is expensive.




**Update:** [Bungie posted answers to some questions about Halo 3: Recon](http://www.bungie.net/news/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=15806). Among note:

"There are multiplayer maps that will appear as a part of the Halo 3: Recon package. This includes the aforementioned Mythic Map Pack in addition to a few others.  You can also experience the entire Recon campaign cooperatively with up to 4 players... The multiplayer maps included with the retail package are straight up Halo 3 multiplayer maps. The ODST and other components that make up the Recon campaign are in a separate bucket and not crossing over into the competitive multiplayer realm."

"We're not ready to discuss the other projects underway within the studio right now but Halo 3 : Recon does represent the final basket of goodness that we will be delivering for the Halo trilogy.  There are no more offshoots or side stories in the works."
