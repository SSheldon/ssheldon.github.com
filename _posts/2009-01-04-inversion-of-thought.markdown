I am supposed to be doing a ton of homework. Know what this means? I'm reading about video games. I don't think people think about control schemes enough; this fundamental part of a video game is overlooked. It's amazing how a control scheme can feel completely natural if it's done right and you use it enough.




 




When one is controlling an object in three-dimensional space in a video game using a controller, traditionally one analog stick is used to control the direction of the viewpoint. At this point, an interesting divergence occurs. Some players want the field of view to move up when they push upwards on the analog stick, and others want it to move down when they push upwards. When phrased like that, the second option sounds inane; this option is called "Y-axis inversion", and is my preference. The uninverted feel that they are controlling the view, while we inverters feel that we are controlling the mechanism that moves the field of view. In an FPS, the uninverted think they are controlling a cursor; push up, and it will move up and move your field of view up; push down and it will move down and move your field of view down. The inverters, however, feel that they are controlling their character's head in an FPS; roll the stick back and your head rolls back and your field of view moves up; roll the stick forward and your head rolls forward and your field of view moves down. The difference comes from whether you think you are controlling a cursor or someone's head. 




 




Curiously, however, nearly everyone agrees that pushing left should move your field of view to the left, and pushing right should move your field of view to the right.




 




This concept of controlling a head versus controlling a cursor made an interesting appearance for me lately. In Fable II, one can enter an aiming mode where they control where their gun is aimed. I feel that the Y-axis in this case should be inverted, because I am controlling my character. However, if you get close to a target, the aim will lock on to that target. If you try to move your aim and there are other targets nearby, it automatically jumps to one of these targets. When this occurs, I no longer feel like I am controlling my character, but rather I'm controlling a cursor. In my mind, the Y-axis should no longer be inverted. If I want my aim to jump to a target above my current one, I feel that I should push up on the analog stick. However, my aim will move down because the game doesn't see any difference between this scenario or freely aiming. It's very confusing to explain, and even more confusing to overcome.




 




Anyways, all of this brings up an interesting question: Why do some people prefer their Y-axis inverted? Is it merely a matter of which scheme you learned first, or are inverters more absorbed in their games, thinking they are controlling a character instead of merely a cursor? It is a question that I am not qualified to answer. Many became accustomed to inverting the Y-axis through flight simulators; when controlling a plane, pulling back on the joystick will pull the plane's nose up and move the field of view up. I used to be one of the uninverted, until a game came along that was inverted by default (Morrowind) and I couldn't figure out how to switch the setting. Since then, I've always played inverted. So, for anyone that actually read this far and plays video games on a control, what are you? One of the uninverted, or an inverter?

_P.S.  
_I've thought some more. [Analog sticks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_stick) track rotation, [mice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_(computing)) track movement, and [touchpads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad) track position. Inverters feel that they are rotating the analog stick. The uninverted feel that they are moving the analog stick. Inverters want their field of view to rotate. The uninverted want their field of view to move. If we accept this logic, then the inverters are correct; the uninverted are not accepting the input device for what it is.
