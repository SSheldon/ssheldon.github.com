Stupid mistakes are killing me. Must teachers be so lame about this? Chemistry grading is normally very reasonable, but on a quiz I accidentally wrote something in my final answer that I had crossed out in my work, and BOOM! 0 points for the problem. Pure bullshit. I think my Precalc teacher is out to get me because I don't take notes. I get points of for the stupidest things. I wrote one of my answers as 80âˆš10 and got a point of because that value doesn't mean anything, yet on the previous test I wrote one of my answers as something like 4.95 and should have left it with a radical! This time I didn't multiply a 4 and a binomial together; apparently he "always has told us we need to do that". Bullshit. I've never heard that before in my life. Ah whatever. Screw school.
