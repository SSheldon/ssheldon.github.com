So, we went to South Dakota. We saw lots of rocks. I guess it was fun. It was a vacation. It's nice to do different stuff, but in the end I want to go back home. As vacations go, it was good. I got to do a lot of what I wanted to do, as evidenced by the programming I got done. I think I did a little too much. When I look at light switches now, I instinctively think "[bool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_datatype)!" If you understand that, you, too, are a nerd. It's okay. Go read XKCD!

    Write(whatWeSaw);
    if (lifeState == vacation) iWantToGoHome = true;
    else itsNiceToDoDifferentStuff = true;
    Write(southDakotaVacation.quality);
    Write(nerdReference);
    if (youUnderstand)
    {
        you = nerd;
        you.Read(XKCD);
    }
