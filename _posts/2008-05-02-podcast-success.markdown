I got everything working! [As I said last night]({% post_url 2008-05-01-feedburner-and-podcast %}), I couldn't make a feed for my podcast that would be useable by programs like the Zune software or iTunes because the SkyDrive servers did not report the proper information about the podcast file when I directly linked to them. However, I solved that problem today. I will be hosting the podcasts additionally on another filesharing website so that I can create a working podcast feed. I am using [HotlinkFiles.com](http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/), a really great service with tons of space and a lot of bandwith. I greatly recommend it if you want a filesharing site that allows you to directly link to your files. However, seeing as my bandwith does have a cap (which I highly doubt I will ever reach unless I turn into some sort of internet sensation), I would appreciate it if you download the podcasts from my SkyDrive if you aren't using a program that is reading the feed and automatically downloading. Thanks, and let's hope that this podcast can be interesting!
