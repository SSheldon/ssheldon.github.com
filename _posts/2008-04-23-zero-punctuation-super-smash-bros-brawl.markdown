[Yahtzee](http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/) reviews [Super Smash Bros. Brawl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl) on [Zero Punctuation](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/zeropunctuation/) this week! The video is following. Be warned, it's very NSFW.

Unfortunately, this quote he said describes me playing Rock Band: "Of course, the problem with playing it alone is that when you finally do get your mates around, suddenly you've turned into _that_ guy. Don't pretend you don't know what I mean! _That_ guy who's so much better than everyone else at the game because he plays it on his own, the _loser_. Suddenly you're not in it for fun anymore and the goonish grins of your uncoordinated friends fill you with contempt. Soon you seek out other _that_ guys for the sake of a decent challenge, and then you're lost; you're a fanboy. Congratulations! Line up for your free t-shirt and cat ears!"
