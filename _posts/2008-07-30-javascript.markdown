So, I've been dabbling in some [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). I don't like it. I prefer my languages [strongly typed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language)... [dynamic typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_typing) seems so... unstructured. Also, the lack of an IDE is a real pain in the arse. I never realized how much easier [Visual C#](http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/) made programming until I started typing up some code in notepad... yeesh. Apparently [Visual Web Developer](http://www.microsoft.com/express/vwd/) supports JavaScript. Maybe I'll try that. I'd really like [the whole of Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vs2008/products/bb894671.aspx)... [they offer it free to college students](https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/Products/Visual_Studio_2008.aspx), but apparently not to high school students. Lame. It's the only way I can find that would allow me to develop apps for the Pocket PC. Maybe if I beg and write nice letters I can get it. Oh well.
