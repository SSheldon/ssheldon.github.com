Wooh! [We](http://www.rockband.com/bands/robot_boxers) beat the endless setlist today! It was a grueling 5 hours, but I'm glad we did it. We were both awfully tired by the end, and I was freakin' starving because I hadn't eaten besides a bowl of cereal 6 hours ago. But it's good, because I got 20G out of it and now my guitarist's icon's colors are inverted! Nifty, eh? Playing through the whole thing on Hard was kind of lame, but I didn't have to worry about failing. It's so much easier on Hard; I made it through [Green Grass and High Tides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Grass_and_High_Tides) without using star power (oops, I mean "overdrive").

After finally getting something to eat, I went to see [21](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(2008_film%29) with Spencer, Caitlin, and a bunch of their friends. Only problem was that the theater was packed. Seriously. We found 4 open seats in the very first row... except there were 7 of us. So we decided, "screw it," and we went to [Vantage Point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantage_Point_(film%29). That was crowded too, but we found enough seats that we could all sit together... in the front row. Anyways, the movie was pretty good, except the rewinding got pretty annoying because I eventually just wanted to know what was going on. The girls were horribly annoying though. Anytime that anything even mildly suspenseful or violent happened, they hid their faces and started yelling "OH MY GOD!" over and over again. HORRIBLY ANNOYING. It pissed me off so bad. Whatever though.

After the movie everyone went back to my house and we played Rock Band (after 5 hours of it already, I wasn't too keen on that, but whatever). I got to drive more than one person, which was nice. It's pretty amazing how bad some people are at that game. I can understand being bad at drums, I guess (although not to the extent that some of these girls were), but it was shocking how bad at singing they were! I never realized how many tone-deaf people there are in the world. Their singing strategy seemed to be totally disregard what was going on in the song and sing everything at the same pitch. Except if the pitch got higher, in which case they yelled. Really loud. And the worst part was that they thought they were doing well! I don't think they realized that, had I not been constantly using star power, they would have failed. Every song. Seriously. ON EASY! Chrissake people! This isn't karaoke, can't you atleast try? So I sang "Still Alive", and got a bunch of "Wow, you're really good!" No, actually it's called being able to sing.

Sorry if I sound like a total jerk. I'm feeling pretty cynical right now.

Anyways, once everyone left Spencer stayed and we played Ikaruga. He believes me that it's hard now :P. We were doing 2-player, which is fun. We didn't get any farther, but Spencer liked Ikaruga and I think he's going to buy it.
