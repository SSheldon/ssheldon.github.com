[As per Runnan](http://ponspk.blogspot.com/2008/05/being-racist.html):

"So, the U. of Chicago has this program to test your racist-ness between blacks and whites. They flash images of blacks and whites, with guns or cell phones, and you have to decide whether to shoot or not to shoot. Your reaction time is supposed to determine your racist-ness. Makes sense."

I didn't think the test made sense, because it was simple object finding and recognition and didn't require any thought about the person's character or give you any time to take in the whole situation, which is where racism could have come in. Anyways, I took it. For some reason, I found it alot easier to identify the guns versus the cell phones. My results corroborate this:

Your Score: 510

Average reaction time:

* Black Armed: 692.12ms
* Black Unarmed: 795.56ms
* White Armed :698.6ms
* White Unarmed: 797.96ms

Basically, my results say that I can identify objects without the race of the person holding them affecting me at all. I can identify guns more quickly than cell phones and can identify objects very very slightly faster when they are held by a black person.

You can see Runnan's results on [his post](http://ponspk.blogspot.com/2008/05/being-racist.html). [Check the game out here](http://backhand.uchicago.edu/Center/ShooterEffect/).
