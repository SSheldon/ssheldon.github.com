W00t! Our campground has free wifi! That's how you are able to read up my awesome adventures... in real time! Today is Spencer's birthday, too! But anyways, back to my adventures...

I woke up in the middle of the night panicked and gasping for breath. My nose had decided to stop being useful and simply close up and instead just become an unsightly bulge on the front of my face. Apparently, I am also retarded and didn't realize I could simply breath through my mouth. This event would set the tone for a good portion of my day.

We woke up around 8 (what an ungodly hour!) and went to eat pancakes and bacon. They passed my test. I think they tasted good. I couldn't really tell because I also couldn't breathe. After the breakfast we were on our way to Mt. Rushmore. I think it was interesting. I spent the whole time breathing through my mouth, dealing with my eyes tearing up, and just generally being miserable. The allergies were really bad.

What's this? A bust of Lenin? At Mount Rushmore? No, unfortunately it's just [Gutzon Borglum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutzon_Borglum).

After the exciting Mt. Rushmore we went to the exciting [Crazy Horse Memorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Horse_Memorial). It's been under construction for 60 years and all they have finished is his face. Besides that they've just dynamited stuff. I doubt that it will ever be finished. There are things asking for donations all over the place at the visitor center. I staunchly refused, because on two seperate occasions the builders have been offered $10 million by the government, yet they refused it because they don't trust the government. I don't think its fair that they refuse a ton of money and then turn around and ask for mine! Besides the giant dynamited rock, their was a gift shop that sold "Indian cultural art". I didn't get anything. We had lunch at some restaurant there, but it's really hard to chew while breathing through your mouth. Again, I was miserable.

On the way back to the campground, we picked up some miracle medicine called [Afrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrin_(nasal_spray)). Apparently it sends storm troopers up your nose and they kick the shit out of anything bothering you. It's amazing. I can breathe perfectly now! Also, I discovered the wifi that the campground has to offer. It's shaping up to be a good afternoon. Well, if anything else interesting happens today I'll update this post.
