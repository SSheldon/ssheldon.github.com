Today started off interestingly enough: I was awoken at 4 by my parents and told to get dressed and get in the car. There was a furious rainstorm occurring and apprently they were concerned that a tree would be struck by lightning, fall on us, and everyone would die. Not a soul in the campground shared this belief because no one else was leaving. We piled into the truck, drove to the bathrooms, and then drove back as the raining stopped. Don't ask me why we would have been safer at the bathrooms. It's a mystery.

Anyways, hours later I actually woke up. It was a relaxed morning. Apparently when it rains we stop trying to follow a schedule. I spent my morning securely wrapped in a sleeping bag while my parents prepared me hot chocolate, egg, ham, & cheese, and bacon. It was quite enjoyable.

We left, went to some tacky tourist attraction. Then we drove through Deadwood, a fake old west town that was actually a gambling mecca. Then we went to Spearfish Canyon. It was really pretty. Then we went back.
