So I finished my _Español para Tontos_ at 4 in the morning. It was an interesting experience. Because I'm such a kind soul, I decided I'd let you see the fruit of my labor. You can download my _Español para Tontos_ in your format of choice below:

  * [PDF](http://cid-bf9cfc6f077ad90a.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/School%20Resources/Spanish/Espa%c3%b1ol%20para%20Tontos.pdf)
  * [XPS](http://cid-bf9cfc6f077ad90a.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/School%20Resources/Spanish/Espa%c3%b1ol%20para%20Tontos.xps)

Don't know what an [.XPS file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Paper_Specification) is? Don't worry, me neither. I was messing around with settings in Word and I can print to it. Apparently it's like Microsoft's PDF. I think that's cool, because Adobe are jerks. All their software is proprietary and too expensive. Apparently XPS is kind of open source. Power to the people!

In other news, Microsoft is selfish. They give their proprietary file type a thumbnail, but not one to the obscenely popular file type of a competitor?
