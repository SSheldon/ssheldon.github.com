“Censorship is telling a man he can't have a steak just because a baby can't chew it.” The simple yet biting words of Mark Twain provide the best definition of censorship, an issue that those who would try to control our lives and those who would protect our freedom have clashed over for hundreds of years. The latest battleground for censorship is the relatively new medium of video games. Lawmakers across the United States have attempted to obstruct the sale of video games with wasteful, misguided, and unnecessary bills; these bills not only waste our money and the time of our representatives, but they infringe upon our rights. We must stop the government from interfering with the sale of video games.




  
Not everyone plays video games; those that don’t mayn’t be concerned with this issue or might even support these attempts. However, this issue affects everyone’s bottom line, because these attempts are doomed to failure from the start and when they fail they cost taxpayers money. In an example that will hit close to home for many reading this, Gov. Rod Blagojevich prohibited the sale or rental of violent or sexually explicit video games to minors with the Safe Games Illinois Act. The bill failed and Illinois was ordered to pay the video game industry more than $0.5 million in attorney fees for the court battle (“Is Legislation Against Narc Doomed?”). In their zeal, Illinois lawmakers ended up robbing half a million dollars from Illinois citizens. This example is not unique; according to Mary Jane Irwin’s “Rated V for Violence”, more than 28 states have attempted to restrict the sale of violent video games to minors. All of these attempts add up to a lot of taxpayers’ money. According to Lara Crigger’s “Your Tax Dollars at Work”, “The Entertainment Software Association, the industry trade group spearheading these court contests, claims that as of 2007, it has recovered more than $1.71 million in legal fees from state governments.” This is a lot of money for taxpayers to pay to support the demagoguing of our politicians. Hal Halpin, president of gamer advocacy group Entertainment Consumers Association, said that, “The research is all very highly recycled. They recycle statistics that are outdated; you see the exact same footage. It's one of the reasons we keep seeing images of Doom, a 15-year-old game, still resurfacing in testimony,” (Crigger, Lara). Politicians aren’t putting a lot of effort into these bills; these failed attempts are merely campaign fodder. Come time for re-election, politicians can point to these pointless attempts to prove that they are crusaders trying to “protect the children”. However, these bills are costing taxpayers money trying to fend off an imaginary evil.




  
When these bills are proposed, people are led to believe that playing video games will turn children into cold-blooded killers. Attorney Katherine Fallow, representing the Entertainment Software Association, said that, “Every single government defendant has raised [the argument that exposure to violent video games is harmful to children] in every single case, and every single court has held it is not sufficient to warrant this kind of [free-speech] restriction,” (Kimberly, James). In all of the costly cases that have gone to court, no research has been shown to be conclusive enough to allow such a bill to pass. Christopher J. Ferguson, a licensed psychologist, in his “Video Games: the Latest Scapegoat for Violence”, said, “Since most young men today play violent video games, … using video-game-playing habits to predict school shootings is about as useful as noting that most or all school shooters were in the habit of wearing sneakers and concluding that sneakers must be responsible for such violence.” Ferguson raises the point that video games have become ubiquitous among young men. If video games were as dangerous as some have claimed, a huge increase in school shootings would be expected. Additionally, Ferguson says, “When a man or woman picks up a weapon and premeditates the end of another human life, it is not because he or she was programmed by a video game but because that individual made a conscious choice -- not to play a game, but to kill,” (Ferguson, Christopher J). Ferguson shows that, even if a game is very violent, a person must still make the choice to kill someone; a video game can’t force you to do that. Video games haven’t been shown to be dangerous for children; however, if parents want to keep violent games away from their children, there are tools at their disposal.




  
The Entertainment Software Ratings Board, or ESRB, is an organization that applies and enforces ratings for video games, much as the Motion Picture Association of American rates films. With these ratings, parents can check the content of any game their children want and ensure that anything they deem unsuitable is kept away from their children. The National Institute on Media and the Family praised the industry for its self-imposed rating system; additionally, ninety percent of all video game purchases are made by adults, and fewer than one in ten games receiving the M-rating ("Keeping violent games away from kids"). Thanks to the ESRB, parents have the power to choose what games their kids are playing and they have plenty of nonviolent options when choosing games. According to the Federal Trade Commission’s latest survey, “With regard to M-rated video games, Game Stop rejected an impressive 94% of underage shoppers, while Wal-Mart and Best Buy spurned 80% of them,” (“Undercover Shoppers… Games”). No extra, unconstitutional laws need to be proposed, because retailers already won’t sell mature games to children. Retailers do a much better job of not selling Mature games to children than they do with any other media. For example, “While Best Buy rejected 80% of underage buyers of video games, it turned away underage shoppers for PAL music only 47% of the time, R-rated movie DVDs only 38% of the time, and Unrated movie DVDs only 17% of the time,” (“Undercover Shoppers… Games”).




  
Since attempts to interfere with the sale of video games cost taxpayers money, are trying to prevent a non-issue, and are unnecessary because of the ESRB, we must stop them. Many may be suspicious of this new form of entertainment, but in time it will be accepted and no longer recognized as a threat. Just because video games shouldn’t be played by everyone doesn’t mean the government needs to step in and make it difficult for those that can play them to do so. We need neither laws to stop babies from eating steak nor laws to stop children from buying games.
