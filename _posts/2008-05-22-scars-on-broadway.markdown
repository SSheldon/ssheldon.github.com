So I'm driving today and I heard a song on the radio, but they didn't say who it was buy. I could've sworn it sounded like System of a Down, and I thought I recognized the singer's voice. Well, in the end I was right! They were playing a single by [Scars on Broadway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scars_on_Broadway), a band formed by the guitarist and drummer from System. It's not particularly that good of a song, but I thought I'd share it with you.
