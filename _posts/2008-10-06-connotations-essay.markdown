_[Note: This is an essay I wrote for an AP prompt in English]_ 


Three revolutionaries sacrifice themselves to the cause. Three terrorists killed in the fight to restore order. Are these statements any different? From a denotative position, these sentences mean nearly the same thing; however, when one reads these sentences, their connotations paint entirely different pictures. The words revolutionary and terrorist are closely related, but their usage depends on if the author wants to show the cause that they are fighting for in a positive or negative light. 


"Revolutionary" is received more favorably than "terrorist" by Americans because America is a country born of revolution. America won its nationhood from the British because of a revolution, a fact any child who has attended American schools can tell you. Because of this, "revolution" still flashes images of heroic patriotism through the minds of Americans: images of Washington crossing the Delaware, of the flag curling in the wind, of rows of red-coated soldiers being driven from the land. By contrast, "terrorist" carries no such positive connotations. Throughout American history, America has supported other countries’ revolutions, too. The French Revolution is a prime example where Americans saw their struggle echoed in another country; Frenchmen fighting for "freedom and democracy" were labeled revolutionaries despite their brutality. Although some would claim the word has been tainted by it association to communist struggles, it nevertheless continues to carry a positive meaning for Americans. Because of these favorable connotations, anyone wanting to promote a political group trying to bring about change can call the members of this group "revolutionaries", and American listeners will identify with and support their cause. 


In the post-9/11 political climate, "terrorist" carries an especially negative connotation. On September 11th, 2001, a terrorist attack rocked the United States. "Terrorist" immediately connects to these attacks in the American mindset, raising thoughts of sadness and fury. Since these attacks, the United States has been waging a "War on Terror". "Terrorist" reminds Americans of the faceless, ruthless enemy in this war. Additionally, this war hasn’t been very successful, so "terrorist" will also raise feelings of frustration and helplessness. All of these connotations make "terrorist" a perfect word for enemies of a political group to use when trying to show the group and their cause in a negative light, especially in the mind of Americans. 


While "revolutionary" speaks about the value of the fighter’s cause without speaking of their level of brutality, "terrorist" speaks of the fighter’s level of brutality without speaking of the value of their cause. A revolutionary is fighting to bring about a revolution; he has an admirable cause, and calling him a revolutionary does not necessarily mean that he uses violent methods to bring about his revolution. On the other hand, a terrorist’s cause may or mayn’t be admirable, but he is most certainly using violent methods. Because of this distinction, the author’s choice of term tells you what they want you to notice about this person. As violence is frowned upon in our culture, "terrorist" is not a very desirable label. Given the choice between "terrorist" and "revolutionary", an author who picks "terrorist" wants to show the fighter as a brute incapable of achieving his goal through peaceful means. The use of "revolutionary" despite a fighter’s use of violence would be meant to show that the fighter’s cause is important enough to merit violence, and will ultimately do more good than the violence used to bring it about. The slight difference in the meaning of these words allows the audience to determine the way the author wants them to see the fighter. 


Looking at the different connotations that "terrorist" and "revolutionary" have acquired despite their similar denotations, we see that their usage depends on whether or not the author wants to display a group’s cause in a positive or negative fashion. What to one side is a ruthless terrorist is a righteous revolutionary to the other.
