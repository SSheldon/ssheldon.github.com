Runnan and I have been messing around on Skype. I've got this program called [PowerGramo](http://www.powergramo.com/) that can record conversations straight from Skype. It's a really nice program, but of course it's shareware. With the freeware version I can still record conversations held by 2 people though, so it works. Runnan has a webcam, which is sweet. If we actually talk about anything maybe I can cobble together a podcast for you with [Audacity](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/04/29/audacity/). That'd be cool for me. I don't think anyone would want to listen to it, but I'd have fun.
