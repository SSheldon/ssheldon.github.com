I haven't been blogging much lately. I dunno, I guess I just don't have that much to say. My life isn't too interesting. Today was an average day. Discontent with our student teacher is reaching a critical mass. Because of poor time management, possibly even on Mr. Stoner's part, but who knows, we will be cramming a speech and a book into the remainder of the school year. The class isn't too happy about that. We were taking notes today on persuasive speaking and no one was paying attention; we were all talking. I've decided that my problem with student teachers is the way that they think of their students. I suppose this doesn't apply to all student teachers, but when I have a problem with one the reason is usually this: they don't respect their students. They just view us as a part of their job and think of us as their inferiors, whereas when you have a good teacher, they treat the students like real, intelligent people.

Anyways, besides drama in the English room, today was uneventful. Spanish is just as painful as ever because we do the same thing everyday. On a (rare) happy note, though, I managed to get a couple perfects in chem today, which is good because my lab grades have been slipping recently.

This afternoon was... frustrating. On one hand, I have an essay/paper to write, but I know that I won't start working on it for a while so I should just have some fun. In the end, I compromise and do nothing. Many squandered opportunities. Although I did take a nice nap. But now it's the middle of the night and I still haven't written my paper. Oh well, welcome to my life.
