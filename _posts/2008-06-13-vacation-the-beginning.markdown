Today we left for vacation! It was uneventful. Disregard my exclamation point. We're driving through Wisconsin and a bunch of roads are closed because of flooding. One highway we were going to take was closed so we had to take a really really slow detour. We're averaging 30 mph. :( We stopped for the night at a hotel. Free wifi ftw! That's how I'm able to update, obviously. I've been working on learning more coding in the car. It's pretty intense. Well, we're leaving early tomorrow, so I suppose I need to cut this short. I'm off to bed. Oh, by the way, I'm sleeping on a window seat in the hotel. How awesome is that? See ya'll!
