Aghh! Work! This is really frustrating. I've been working on setting up a feed for my "podcast". The feed provided for this blog won't do any good, but Live Spaces can make feeds for individual categories. I'm burning the feed for [my podcast category](/blog/categories/podcast/) with [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/) because it has a service that will detect a link to a media file and then embed the a link to the file in your post. Podcast downloading programs then check an RSS feed you provide them and will download any embedded files. I'm hosting my podcast on SkyDrive, and was able to get a direct link to the file against Microsoft's will, as described [here](http://d3vmax.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!73AF9C0F050E35D9!33451.entry). Unfortunately, though, FeedBurner doesn't detect my links as media files, so it won't embed them. Why is this you ask? Well, the SkyDrive servers that host my podcast file don't report the correct content MIME type. If I host the file on my Geocities it works fine, except I don't get enough storage space on my Geocities to fit even one podcast. So, until Microsoft changes the SkyDrive servers or I find another file hosting website, it looks like there won't be a podcast feed for this website.
