So Marius had his Eagle Court of Honor and then his party today. The CoH was pretty good; the person who was telling the funny stories about Marius actually told one about an act committed by other scouts, which was pretty funny. I was supposed to wear my sash, but none of my patches had been sewn on, so I ended up duct taping them on. That was pretty funny.




 




The party was fun. We had some neat German food, and I had buttered bread with salami, too, which was actually really good. All of Marius' friends were hanging out and all the scouts that came were screwing around and being annoying. We went to the park later and just kind of messed around there, and then we returned to his house later. Some others and I were playing cards in the gazebo; we played [Egyptian Ratscrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Ratscrew) first  and then [Mao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(game)). Mao sucks. It's a game where you don't know the rules and have to figure them out as you play. It's frustrating. All in all, it was a good time. Congratulations Marius!
