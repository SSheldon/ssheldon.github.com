It's horribly cold outside. We got quite a bit of snow last night, and it made driving hazardous in the morn. Apparently, the school was not concerned with our health; it called us forth from our safe homes, luring us out with _the law_. We fell for it's cruel devices-_oh, woe!_-and now I must tell the horrible tale of what occured as we tried to return to our homes.

Runnan and I, by some cruel twist of fate, had to trek home on foot. Throughout our arduous journey, we saw terrible things. The landscape was a wasteland, cloaked in white, and it was nearly impossible to find one's way through it.

As we continued with our exodus from the school through this frozen tundra, we saw a dead dog lying in the snow. Children, lost and confused, trying to find their way home from school, were near starving, and we watched as they descended upon the dog. Runnan and I managed to keep our wits about us. We lit a fire in an old trash barrel, part of it's green paint still visible in an attempt to mock us by reminding us the color the earth once had. As the pack of feral children felt the warmth from our fire and smelled the smoke, the rushed towards us. Runnan and I had to break into a sprint, barely able to escape them.

We finally cleared this frozen area and reached someplace where the ground was not frozen and white, but rather wet and black. As the terrified survivors of this horror fleed from our small town, they sped away along this road, nearly killing us. It took a while for us to be able to cross this dangerous area. We considered flagging down some of the desperate survivors, but I feared that they may have resorted to cannibalism already. 

At this point, Runnan and I considered ourselves very near home. It was impossible to tell, of course, because of the terrifying snow covering everything. I shuddered to think of what I might find waiting for me at home. Perservering, Runnan and I chanted survival rule #34: Never slow down! We would make it. Someday, I knew we would...
