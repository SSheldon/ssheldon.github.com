So, tomorrow's the big day! Wooh, eh? I'll be getting confirmed tomorrow. A lot of time today was spent in preparation for that. We're having a party, so we've been cleaning the house and my mom's been cooking and my dad's been finishing up some work on the basement. The basement is looking really good. I went to a confirmation practice tonight, too. It was... interesting. Full of the usual large dose of religiousisms and such, but I made it through and now know what I need to say tomorrow. Despite the large preparation efforts today, I ended up wasting a lot of time. Probably because I barely clean. Oops...

Marius came over today, and we were entertaining some nostalgia. We played some Rock Band for a while and then some Halo 3 campaign. I just get random urges to replay games, and then when I go do that I don't even enjoy it that much. Oh well, it was still pretty fun.
