Today was... a day. I took 4 tests. We had our _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ test today. It was full of ambiguous questions, as was to be expected. We learned that our paper is due Tuesday, and there hasn't been any mention of it for a long time so we were all shocked. No one is happy about having Ms. Ivers, and we all want Mr. Stoner back. Uy. Oh well, the year is almost over. Anyways, after that I had a test in band; it's the written exam everyone has to take. I then took a Chem test which seemed to go pretty well for me. We had a sub in Math, so it was a work day; I was going to check my answers, but these girls had the answer key for the entire period. It was pretty lame. I also had a "test" in Intro to Biz. I don't think I can convey how little respect I have for that class. It's such a joke; thank god I'm in Honors classes, otherwise I'd probably go crazy in normal classes.




 




After watching Thursday's _The Office_ and _Scrubs, _playing Halo with Runnan ([I got a Killing Frenzy and Splatter Spree!](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/GameStatsHalo3.aspx?gameid=487419886&player=CouchPotato99)), and driving Greg to some Baseball thing, I spent the rest of my evening installing some games on my Zune. I followed the [tutorial found here](http://www.zuneboards.com/forums/tutorials/23605-installing-game-xna-your-zune.html), and now I have [Galaxy Wars 3](http://www.zuneboards.com/forums/download-completed-games/23614-ctp-galactic-wars-3-thrust.html), [AlienAggressors](http://www.zuneboards.com/forums/download-completed-games/23612-ctp-alien-aggressors.html), and [Sir Tet](http://www.zuneboards.com/forums/download-completed-games/23753-beta-sir-tet-tetris.html) on my Zune. I recommend Sir Tet. Oh, and if you can't install AlienAgressors because you're missing the Segoe UI font family, you can download it [here](http://downtown.vc/index.php?page=main&id=4ecb1506&name=[uploaded by - sirqueza]) (you only need the 4 basic ones) or it can be found in [here](http://invasiondivine.deviantart.com/art/IDnueusVI-58541349). More games can be found [here](http://www.zuneboards.com/forums/download-completed-games-174/).
