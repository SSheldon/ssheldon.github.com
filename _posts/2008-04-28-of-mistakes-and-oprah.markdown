'Twas a Monday. The wonderful day when freedom (or in my case, boredom) comes to a halt and one returns to the grind. As Mondays go, it wasn't the best. We had a sub in Spanish, which meant that we were doing work pages for the whole period. I was incredibly mad; that class just puts me in a really pissy mood. I haven't gotten a perfect lab in Chemistry for such a long time because I keep making stupid mistakes. I missed 2 points this time because I forgot to provide the units on some measurements. I would've argued with the Dr., but I hadn't the heart. I made some stupid mistakes on Math quizzes (and the teacher was being unreasonable in one instance). In Intro to Biz we had an unlikable sub, and we watched Oprah. It was horrible. Something about that program is just too much for me to bear. I ended up listening to music just so I wouldn't have to hear the progam.




 




After school I had scouts. It was a PLC. I didn't pay attention, I just spent the whole time writing Spanish words in IPA as part of a project I'm doing. Using the IPA isn't mandatory, but I'm really interested in it so it almost makes me want to do the project.
