Some sweet new footage of the Legendary Map pack, [straight from Bungie themselves](http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=13509). If you aren't excied, what's wrong with you? Read [this article](http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=13475). And watch [this other trailer](http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=13469). 


Oh yeah. That's right, I am a Halo fanboy. Nevermind, I forgive you for not being excited. Still, you should be excited... 


Avalanche doesn't seem like a very faithful remake of Sidewinder, but then again my memory isn't so good. However, I don't seem to remember a sheer cliff right at the edge of the turning point of the map... The neutered Hornet should be cool. There'll finally be one available in matchmaking!
