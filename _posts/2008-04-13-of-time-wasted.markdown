Yay. Sunday night. That means cramming in all the homework I should have done over the weekend and dreading the coming day.




 




What have I done today? Nothing. Went to confirmation, ate doughnuts, waited for it to end. Went to Best Buy with Spencer, screwed around on Guitar Hero and bought some MSP. Came home, finally got to chapter 3 of Ikaruga, wasted some time. Ate dinner, got in trouble with my parents, tried to do homework. Mixed homework and wasting time, and here I am now. Exciting, eh? Oh well, should probably finish homework and get some sleep. Life's a drag, but what'ch'ya gonna do?
