Well, looks like Live Spaces is preparing to keel over. Turned out to be a pretty good deal for me, since my blog got moved to a fully-fledged blogging platform in the proccess. Does this herald a new era of blogging for me? Probably not. I'm still just as lazy as before. But perhaps being in college will give me things to talk about that other people want to hear... Who am I kidding, I'm also as boring as before.Â Regardless, Hello World Wordpress!
