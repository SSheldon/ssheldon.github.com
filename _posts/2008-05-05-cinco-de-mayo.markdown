That's right, everyone, it's [that famous Mexican holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo)! I celebrated it by living through a mediocre day. Ooh, how unusual... Nothing much to report besides that I'm freakin' horrible at titrating things and that the quiz we took in English was utterly retarded and full of ambiguous questions.




 




At scouts we did some stuff with maps, and I just read while this was going on. We practiced some stuff for Marius' Eagle Court of Honor, too.




 




I played some of [the Cinco de Mayo playlist in Halo 3](http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=news&cid=13725). It was pretty fun, but it just seemed like the person with the rockets wins. For those of you that don't know, everyone spawns with random weapons. Fiesta Kind and the Oddball game are exceptionally lame, but the normal Fiesta slayer was fun. I managed to get 2 overkills because of the 8 person free-for-all. Also, at one point on the Pit I spawned in the top of one of the towers with a sniper and infite ammo, so I camped there for the rest of the game.
