Nothing really happened today. Seriously. [I went to solo and ensemble in the morning](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/04/19/solo-and-ensemble/), then came home and spent the rest of the day here. I played some Halo and was on my computer for the whole day. Pretty lame, eh? I was supposed to watch "[Shaun of the Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_of_the_Dead)", but that plan fell through. Oh well. Maybe tomorrow will bring excitement and adventure?
