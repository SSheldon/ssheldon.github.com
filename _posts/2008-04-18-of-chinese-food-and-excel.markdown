Wow I've got a bad memory, but I'll try. Here goes:




 




Thursday: We started electronic checking in Intro today. It's horrible. If I take CBA I may very well die. I am not kidding when I tell you that the teacher said, "See that thing next to the keyboard? That's the number pad!" She considered us an "Excel wiz" if we knew how to change cell color. Yikes. After school, Marius, Katie and I practiced our ensemble for the upcoming competition. We'll see how that goes. I was driven by Katie for the first time since she got her liscense; I'm sure she'll be fine, but her driving is still a little rough around the edges now. Oh, and also, this night was pretty funny, as I fell asleep at 10:30 on accident and then woke up at 4:00 to finish my homework really quickly before going back to bed for a while. That's why I failed to update then.




 




Friday: We started watching "[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo's_Nest_(film))" in English today. It seems enjoyable so far. Did more checking in Intro, and I only have one month left to do. We are supposed to do like 4 months and I've done 6 so far. After school I went to Lily Garden with Jessica, Katie, Spencer, and Marius. I didn't enjoy the food there too much because I prefer the food of [Chen's King Wok](http://www.kingwokchinese.com/). Anyways, I ordered chicken and broccoli but mostly just ate sweet and sour chicken and pork fried rice from everyone else. It was fun, except for Jessica and Spencer's (although to a lesser extent) disregard for proper public behavior. Stuff was being thrown, Jessica was swearing loudly with an adult couple right behind us, and they were even playing the penis game. I hate it when people act like that, but I also hate being a stick in the mud and acting like everyone's mom. Whatever. I can understand why most adults think that all teenagers are jerks. Afterwards, Marius ended up at my house and we played some Halo 3 on the new maps to show them to Spencer. I think he enjoyed them once he wasn't playing Legendary Brawl (which sucks, btw). Afterwards I was pretty well exhausted so I just went to bed.
