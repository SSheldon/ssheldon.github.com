So they guy who makes [VG Cats](http://www.vgcats.com/) is making this new mini-series, [Super Effective](http://www.vgcats.com/super/). For anyone who's played the original pok√©mon games (that should be all of you), it is hilarious. If you don't want to read all of them (Oh jeez, 3 webcomics! Ahh!) then you at least need to read [this one](http://www.vgcats.com/super/?strip_id=1). I couldn't help laughing when I read that comic, only because it is so true and the characters' expressions are so brilliant.
