Interesting day so far. We still haven't finished Hamlet in English, but there is only one scene left for the exciting conclusion. The [movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1996_film%29) we watch along with it is actually good, although I don't agree with some of Branagh's takes on things. I must say, though, that moving the time from the Elizabethan era to the early 20th century make the move seem a lot less lame. We learned some new tense in Spanish. I don't remember too much about it because I fell asleep after getting the basics down. It's a piece of cake, though. Chemistry test wasn't too bad, and we gave a knock-'em-dead awesome presentation in Intro to Biz. Like Marius said though, the bar is set so low in that class that we couldn't possibly have done poorly on it.

I was just playing [Ikaruga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga). It's awfully fun, but it's one helluva hard game. I can't even get through the first level on normal. I've read that it's kind of short, so I'm hesitant to buy it for $10, but it is definately fun, so we'll see.

Not quite sure what I'm going to do with my time tonight, seeing as all I have is math homework. Maybe I can finally play Brawl? \*cough\*Spencer\*cough\*

Will update if anything interesting happens.
