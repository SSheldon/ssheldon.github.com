Is math too hard for you? Are you tired of triginometry because you keep having to deal with that pesky pi? Is finding the volume of a sphere driving you crazy? Well fret not! Today, I propose to you a simple solution: Potatian Algebra! When solving a problem using Potatian Algebra, simply add this at the beginning of the problem:

Assume Ï€=1

Now that problem doesn't look so daunting, eh? What's the radius of a circle with a diameter of 2? 2! What's the volume of a sphere with a radius of 3? 36! No more pesky pi! Talk to your math teacher about Potatian Algebra today!
