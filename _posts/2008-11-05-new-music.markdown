I've picked up some new songs lately. I've been listening to the radio a lot because I realized that my Zune gets good reception once the backlight goes off. Good stuff. Anyways, here are the latest additions to my music collection:

* "[Feel Good Drag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feel_Good_Drag)" by [Anberlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anberlin) from "[New Surrender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Surrender)"
* "[The Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Distance_(song%29)" by [Cake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_(band%29) from "[Fashion Nugget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Nugget)"
* "New Noise" by [Refused](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refused) from "[The Shape of Punk to Come](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_Punk_to_Come)"
