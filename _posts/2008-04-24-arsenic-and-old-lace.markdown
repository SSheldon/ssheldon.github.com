I just got back from seeing "[Arsenic and Old Lace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_and_Old_Lace_(play%29)" as presented by CLS. It was really great! The humor was quite enjoyable, the plot was amusing, and the acting was top-notch. A certain fellow who was runnin' yo' ang performed very well. I greatly enjoyed it, and if anyone is actually reading this I suggest you go!
