Ah yes, the White Hills. To the common folk, they are known as the [Badlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_National_Park). However, before the Europeans arrived and began calling them badlands, they were known as the White Hills by the Lakota. I like that name better, because then you have the White Hills and the [Black Hills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills). Neat, eh?




 




Anyways, before we went to the Badlands National Park, we went to the [Minuteman Missile Silo National Historic Site](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuteman_Missile_National_Historic_Site). Saw some pretty interesting stuff. Nothing shocking or unexpected. One of the guys who was actually working the command center talked to us about it.




 




After this we went off to the park. It's pretty spectacular. I think it's comparable to, perhaps more beautiful than the Grand Canyon. We ate lunch at a restaurant that they have at the bottom of the White Hills. Afterwards, Greg and I climbed up some hill. It was a very treacherous climb full of loose gravel and shar dop-offs. When I say "hill", I don't mean gentle, rolling hill like we have in Illinois. This was a badlands hill. My parents only made it halfway, but we went all the way to the top. At the top it was very surreal; it suddenly got very quiet and VERY flat. As far as I could see it was just dirt, grass, and the occasional plateau. Weird indeed. The bottom of the White Hills was very hot. It was quite a shock after being in the cold Black Hills. We resumed our driving tour of the White Hills. Some of the scenery was incredible. There was one part that had tons of prairie dogs. It was cool. After we had driven a good length of the park, we headed back out to the highway and returned to the camper.
