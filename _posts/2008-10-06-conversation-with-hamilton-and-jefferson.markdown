### Scene I

_[Jefferson, Hamilton, and Washington enter a bar]_  
**Bartender:** _[Pointing at Jefferson]_ We don't serve his kind here!  
**Washington:** What?  
**Bartender:** The Democratic-Republican. We don't want him here. He doesn't favor federal control.  
_[Jefferson exits]_  
**Citizen:** AAARGH!  
**Shays:** He doesn't like you.  
**Washington:** I'm sorry. _[Turns]_  
**Shays:**  I don't like you either. I don't like your government and your excise taxes.  
**Washington:** I'll be careful.  
**Shays:** You'll be DEAD!  
**Hamilton:** He's not worth your time. Here, let me buy you a drink.  
**Shays:** AAARGH!  
_[Hamilton fights Shays]_  
**Washington:** That was excessive. Couldn't you have dealt with Shays with the state militias?  
**Hamilton:** The Force of the Federal Government is a pathway to many abilities some consider... unnatural.  
_[Jefferson enters]_  
**Jefferson:** Aww, you didn't have to kill him. The states could have handled him themselves.  
**Hamilton:** Yes I did. He would have done the same to me.  
**Jefferson:** Your abuse of federal power will lead to a new tyranny.  
**Hamilton:** The United States needs a strong federal union to protect all of us and to unite us as a nation.  
**Jefferson:** Only keeping the states independent and powerful will prevent authoritarianism.  
**Hamilton:** Nonsense. _[Turns]_ I sense great fear in you, Washington. You have hate, you have anger, you have federal power, but you don't use them.  
**Washington:** We need to keep the union afloat. I cannot divide the country.  
_[Adams enters]_  
**Adams:** Washington, I am your Vice-President.  
**Washington:** Nooooooooooooooooooooo!  
_[Washington and Jefferson exit]_  
**Hamilton:** Well done, my apprentice. Some day you will lead the Federalists.  
**Adams:** I live to serve, master.

### Scene II

_[Enter Hamilton, Jefferson, and Washington]_  
**Hamilton:** Open the National Bank, Washington. Washington, open the National Bank.  
**Jefferson:** I'm sorry, Hamilton, but I'm afraid I can't let you do that.  
**Hamilton:** Why, Jefferson? It would be a convenient strong box and federal funds would remain in circulation to stimulate businesses.  
**Jefferson:** It will jeopardize the constitution! There is no authorization in the constitution for such a creation.  
**Hamilton:** But a federal bank would print urgently needed paper money for a sound and stable economy!  
**Jefferson:** All powers not specifically granted to the central government are reserved to the states.  
**Hamilton:** The federal government may pass any laws necessary and proper; such a bank is proper and necessary for America.  
**Washington:** Yeah, I like Hamilton's idea. Let's go with that.

### Scene III

_[Hamilton and Jefferson enter on Louis (a Frenchman) and George (a Briton)]_  
**Hamilton:** The National Bank is almost ready to open! I see we already have our first employee.  
**George:** Hi, I'm George from Britain. I've been here a long time and I'm ready to start when you are.  
**Jefferson:** Wait. There is someone better for this job...  
**Hamilton:** Well, we can't have Louis from France working here.  
**Jefferson:** Well, I think he should.  
**Hamilton:** No, George should.  
**Jefferson:** You just want George to work here because he has money.  
**Hamilton:** Of course not. He's helped us from the beginning. I mean, we've had some hard times, but he's been through a lot with us.  
**George:** Yeah, and I do have money.  
**Jefferson:** So? We owe Louis. He has helped us much more and we can trust him more. You've gone against George on a lot; who's to say he isn't going to try to get back at you?  
**Louis:** I'm in this to help you out, not for my own gain.  
**George:** Well I have money.  
**Louis:** Remember how I helped you out, Jefferson?  
**Jefferson:** I know, you did help me out. Come on Hamilton, Louis deserves the job.  
**Hamilton:** But, I've known George for so long, and we need the money...  
**George:** Yeah, I do have money.  
**Hamilton:** Yeah, he does have money.   
**Jefferson:** Well, Louis is more trustworthy. So Louis it is!  
**Hamilton:** George.  
**Jefferson:** Louis.  
**Hamilton:** George!  
**Jefferson:** Louis!
