8 to 2:30.Â  16.5 hours in the car. It was brutal. We drove through many a state. I spent most of the ride programming. I got together a releasable version of Minesweeper for Zune! We ate breakfast in the camper, had lunch at a McDonalds, and dinner at KFC. We also grabbed snacks at many gas stations. All in all, I ate an incredible amount of crap. I slept after midnight because I was tired of being awake. Not much happened. It was a LOT of sitting. I'm glad we finally got home. It was in the middle of the night, and I just dropped my stuff in my room and went to sleep. It's good to be home where the internet doesn't run at a glacial pace!
