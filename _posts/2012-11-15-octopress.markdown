I really like git; if I could keep everything under version control, I would.
I've started writing all my papers in LaTeX instead of Word, not only because
it's cleaner and can provide more control, but because then I can version
control them. Hell, I've even started keeping my Borderlands 2 game saves
backed up in a git repository.

Imagine my delight, then, when I discovered [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
Octopress is a framework that makes it really easy to generate a blog just from
a set of markdown files that can be hosted on
[GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/). I've already been using GitHub to
host my personal website, and using it to host a blog would be pretty swell.

I've worked through the documentation to get a blog up and running; after all,
I have homework to be working on right now, so I need to find something else to
do. Nevermind the fact that I never actually put in the effort to blog or can
come up with interesting topics; if nothing else, this was just an exercise to
test out Octopress and to become more familiar with the features of GitHub
pages.
