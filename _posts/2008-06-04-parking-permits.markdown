BULLSHIT!

Right, now that I have your attention (actually, I just needed to vent)...

To park in the school's parking lot, one needs a parking permit (more commonly referred to as a parking sticker). Currently, students fill out applications. The seniors get their stickers and then any remaining parking spaces are given to the Juniors by the football coach. The system is complete garbage. 

If a student lives within a certain distance of the school, they will not provide bussing for that student. These students must then find their own transportation; the point is that bussing these students would be inefficient because they can walk or ride bikes to school, but they could live a considerable distance from the school, so walking to and from school each day is a great inconvenience. This plan also degenerates when it is raining or very cold out; in these situations, the student must find someone who can drive them to school. Because it isn't always guaranteed that a ride will be available and having someone drive you is a great incovenience to that person (and impossible for some), it is a much better solution for these students to drive to school if they are able. To do this without having to pay a ridiculous price for a temporary parking space, the student needs a parking sticker.

Let's stop dealing in generalities here. I am one of those lucky students who does not recieve bussing. I live around a mile away from the school; in times of good weather, I usually ride my bike to school. If it is raining or too cold, my mom can usually drive me to school, but that is an inconvenience to her and I often can't find a ride home so I must walk home regardless of the weather. I've had my license since October of 2007 and haven't been in any accidents. My life would be a lot easier if I could drive to school, and I have my license, so I applied for a parking sticker. I'm a model student who needs a parking sticker and has a good driving records; I should get one, right?

WRONG! Here's how the order goes:

  1. Seniors - They're older, they deserve a parking sticker more. Makes perfect sense, right? No, it's retarded. 
  2. Juniors in sports (especially football)  - The junior athletes get first dibs on the leftovers because they need some way to get home after practice. That's fair. Then the rest of the parking stickers go to...
  3. Random juniors - seriously. The rest of the parking stickers are distributed with no method or reason. I know a girl who got one who doesn't even have a license. One girl has a bus and can barely drive (she failed the driving test), yet she gets one.

This order is idiotic. It doesn't take into account who NEEDS a parking sticker. Tons of seniors with busses get stickers simply because they are older. Is it fair that a senior with a bus gets a sticker while a junior without transportation doesn't? Is it fair that a senior who has been driving for a shorter period of time than a junior will get a parking sticker? I think not. I propose this new system: 

  1. Athletes - they may not be within walking distance of the school, so they will need to be able to drive home after practices. 
  2. Students without busses - if these students can drive, they should not have to walk to school or inconvenience their parents. 
  3. Remaining students - then the rest of the students can get parking stickers.

Withing each of these steps, the order the students get a parking sticker should go thusly: 

  1. Carpooling - students who will drive more people to school should get a parking sticker if the people they are driving don't apply for a sticker. 
  2. Experience - students who have had their license longest should get a parking sticker first.
  3. GPA - good students should be rewarded in some way; a diligent student is likely a trustworthy student. Those with higher GPAs should get stickers first. 
  4. Grade - if the above steps fail to flesh out a suitable order, a senior should get a parking sticker before a junior. It's a perk of seniority that everyone will recieve eventually.

If there still aren't enough parking spaces to go around, the school could consider offering seasonal parking stickers for athletes. That way they won't need to take up a parking space if they don't have a sport that they will need to drive home from. 

Some would say that my system is biased and geared towards getting me a parking sticker before others. I would agree. Don't you think that the student who doesn't have a way to get to school needs to drive before the student who just wants to leave for lunch, regardless of age?
