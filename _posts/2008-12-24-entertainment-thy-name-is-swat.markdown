Long days snowed in without the imminent threat of homework breed boredom. And boredom breeds a desire to play Halo. That's right ladies and gentlemen, I am back to playing Halo. I do love me some Team SWAT. When I am not being mercilessly destroyed or dragged down by my team, I play pretty well. Like [the above game](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/GameStatsHalo3.aspx?gameid=885493287&player=CouchPotato99), where I got 22 kills without dying for the entirety of the match. Ah, memories.
