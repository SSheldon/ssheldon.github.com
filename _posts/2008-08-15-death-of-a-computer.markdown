So... my laptop kicked the bucket. I'm using my brother's computer. So yeah. Won't be seeing many posts from me. We just sent it off to the "Micro Medics"... I don't trust these... "medics". Are they aware that you cannot give medicine to a computer? It was still in warranty so I was forced to send it there to have it fixed. I would have rather tried to fix it myself. I'm sure you all will hear when it's fixed. In the meantime, play [Braid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game))Â or read [this post by Red](http://lessgravity.wordpress.com/2008/08/15/old-school-goes-high-tech/)!
