Today Runnan and I had a project: we would make t-shirts out of [the designs I made yesterday](http://flickr.com/photos/couchpotato99/sets/72157605187270339/detail/). It was an arduous process (complicated by the fact that my Mom was seriously mad at me), but we perservered. The first step was to buy the special paper stuff; we went to hobby lobby, and while there Runnan met his twin!


We bought shirts at K-mart and then went home to start printing and ironing the designs. It was a long process, but it turned out pretty well.

Expect to see various people wearing these tomorrow. RUNNAN REVOLUTION! Oh yeah, we also taped "Vote Runnan" on the side of the school by the main entrance. There's quite a campaign going on here.
