Ah, [the library](http://www.crystallakelibrary.org/). An institute of intellect and high culture. Wait, what's this? (I'll leave it to you to figure out what's wrong. NO, it isn't that an institute of high culture is advocating video gaming; video games are high culture! Elitist pig... All the stupid people are really confused now. Wow, I think this is the longest thing I've ever put inside a set of parenthesis. Barring [math problems]({% post_url 2008-05-20-welcome-to-calculus %}), of course)

Joking aside, I enjoy our library. I told someone inside, and she seemed very upset and embarassed about it. She was going out to fix it as I was leaving. The [TEAL](http://www.jeffdeck.com/teal/) would be proud...
