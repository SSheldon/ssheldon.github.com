Well, today is Wednesday. Yay? Not sure, it isn't bad so far.




 




Where was I yesterday, you ask? I was prioritizing and budgeting my time! Strange, in'nit? I was in and ready for bed at 9:20, an entirely strange experience. Nevermind that I went to bed at 10:30. I was so eager to sleep because I had gone to bed at 2:45 the previous night and was exhausted. Running through the day on less than four hours of sleep was interesting. I was really slap-happy at some times, and really sleepy at others. I took a test in English (FUTURE KNOWLEDGE: it turned out well). We had a sub in Chem; she was cool and the teacher who taught before Dr. Sukel took over. Brandon was making fun of me because I was so tired, so like the whole period the sub treated me like I was retarded; not in a bad way or anything, but just like I had trouble understanding everything. We ran the mile in gym, which I got a 9:32 on. I know, I know, I'm slow, but at least I did it without walking, eh? Once home I bought "Saints of Los Angeles" by [Mötley Crüe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe) [for Rock Band](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/04/15/saints-of-los-angeles-debuts-on-rock-band/) and the Legendary Map Pack for Halo 3. "Saints of Los Angeles" is fun to play and the new maps seem pretty sweet. [Blackout](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Blackout_(Level)) is [Lockout](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Lockout), not much new to see there. [Avalanche](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Avalanche_(Level)) is huge and looks like it should be really sweet to play on. They took a lot of liberties in calling it a "[Sidewinder](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Sidewinder_(Level)) remake", though. I haven't played a game on [Ghost Town](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Ghost_Town_(Level)) yet and I don't know the layout, but it looks cool, too. I ended up going out and buying fleece for a Confirmation project. It took a while and I was getting tired, but at least my friday is free now.




 




Today isn't too interesting of a day. Our student teacher started in English today. I'm not too happy about that; so far I prefer Mr. Stoner's teaching style and I've had some bad experiences with student teachers in the past. Why are my student teachers always teaching English, the class that changes the most depending on the teacher? Oh well. Maybe she can break the mould and be an outstanding teacher. Anyways, the rest of the day went by uneventfully. We were having carpet installed in the living room, so my dad stayed home. He decided to start sanding the basemet walls, which means no Xbox for me! I really wanted to try the maps and now I can't. This really sucks. I also had to hook the router back up, and now my computer is downloading slow as shit. It's horribly frustrating. HORRIBLY! I can't take it! It took me 30 seconds to download a 200 Kb image! Ugh.




 




A Geico ad just flew by my window. What the hell? If anyone hasn't heard of Geico by now they need to buy a TV. Are these people so shameless?
