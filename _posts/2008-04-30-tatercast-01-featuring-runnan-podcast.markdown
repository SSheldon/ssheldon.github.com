So, Runnan and I had some interesting discussions throughout the course of our [Skyping](http://couchpotato99.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!BF9CFC6F077AD90A!325.entry). Seeing as I had too much time on my hands and wanted to mess with Audacity, I cobbled together a podcast from our discussions. Listen as we talk politics, public education, and plenty of nonsense! Can this really be called a podcast? I don't really care, but that's what it is now! This wonderful picture is of Runnan messing with his webcam; black Runnan! The podcast can be downloaded from my SkyDrive, which is accessed by clicking on the purdy icon at the end of this post, or you can subscribe to the feed and have it downloaded automatically for you from your software of choice.
