So would it annoy you all if I wrote like [θ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta)is? If you haven't noticed someθi[ŋ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eng_(letter%29) funny about θis, you aren't so bright. Dammit. I can't θink of a word to use my last character... ah! How about [ʃ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esh_(letter%29)eep or ʃell or ʃip?

Now I just need a character for "[ch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch_(digraph%29)". Besides θat all of the other Eŋlish [digraphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography%29) can be represented easily. Our laŋuage is so full of superfluous letters or unclear spelliŋs. Θat's θe beauty of θe [IPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA)!
