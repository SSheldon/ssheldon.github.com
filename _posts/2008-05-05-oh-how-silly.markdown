More things being cleaned off my website? Yes, it would appear that way. Here are a couple funny quotes I've gathered over time:

  * "Jesus took 3 days to respawn... Talk about lag!" -- Unknown 
  * "And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle, so that Man could fight the dinosaurs. And the homosexuals. Amen." -- Homechooled Boy in [Mean Girls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/) 
  * "Imagine a moshpit in an emo concert...'oh noes my eyeliner! no one ever loves me!'" -- [Chrisz0r](http://live.xbox.com/member/Chrisz0r) 
  * "If he’d been running around campus with a sword yelling “FOR THE HORDE!” every time he cut someone down? You might have a case. Here? Not so much." -- [CFTC](http://gamepolitics.com/2007/04/17/dr-phil-blames-video-games-for-virginia-tech-massacre/#comment-70480) 
  * "I know that I'm a man, and you are a collection of electrons and 1s and 0s displayed through my computer monitor. As such, carrying your child would be completely impossible, and if it were possible, it would be an affront to nature. Regardless, I wish to have your baby." -- [chenry](http://www.joystiq.com/2007/05/16/bungie-i-am-so-mad-at-you/#c4935373)
