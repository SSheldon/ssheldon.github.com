So I haven't blogged in quite a while, eh? Nothing interesting going on. I've just been frittering away time. Anyways, one thing I've spent a lot of time on is my [Zune Minesweeper](http://www.codeplex.com/zuneminesweeper). Since version 2 it's had more than 300 downloads </brag>. Every once in a while I google "Zune Minesweeper" and see what I find. Recently I found out that they talked about me on [the "This Week on Channel 9" show from June 11th](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/This-Week-on-C9-Imagine-Cup-hosted-services-C-40-and-ASPNET-tips/). If you don't know, here's a little bit [from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_9_(discussion_forum)) about [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/):

Channel 9 features video channels, podcasts and screencasts including interviews with Microsoft developers about their products, discussion, and a wiki, which has been adopted by various Microsoft teams as a way to aggregate feedback and respond to issues."_




Anyways, here's the part where I show up:
