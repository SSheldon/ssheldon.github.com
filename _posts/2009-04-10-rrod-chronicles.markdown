My Xbox 360 red ringed a while ago. The repair process this time was very quick, and since I haven't blogged in a while I might as well share a timeline with you.

* ~February 14 - My Xbox 360 red rings again, but this time turning it on and off and unplugging cords won't revive it.
* March 29 - I finally call customer support, and the agent is very helpful.
* April 4 - I recieve my shipping label from Microsoft.
* April 6 - I ship my console to the repair center.
* April 8 - My console arrives in Mesquite, Texas at the repair center.
* April 9 - Microsoft reports that my console has arrived, and repairs begin and are completed.
* April 13 - Microsoft ships my console back to me.
* April 17 - I recieve my repaired console.

Wow. 1 day to fix my console? That's efficiency. Guess they do get a lot of RRODs. Hopefully I'll have it back by Monday or Tuesday.
