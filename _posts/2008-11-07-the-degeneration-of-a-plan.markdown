I'm feeling whiny. Things haven't gone my way to do. Since I'm feeling sorry for myself, I figured I'd catalog every way my plan for tonight went wrong.

**Plan:** While I'm at school, my mom buys Gears of War 2 for Spencer and I at Circuit City to take advantage of their deal; after school, I drive to her work with Spencer to get it from her and then Spencer and I proceed to play co-op for most of the night over Xbox Live.

**Problems (in order of occurence):**

1. My mom won't let me go to her work immediately after school; she wants me to wait until 4:30 and meet her halfway when she goes grocery shopping.
2. Circuit City was out of 1600 MSP cards when my mom arrived, so we didn't get to take advantage of the deal.
3. My mom is working late, so after waiting till 4:30 so that I won't need to drive all the way to her work, I learn that I will be driving all the way to her work anyways.
4. Spencer is gone when I leave to go pick up the game, so I drive by myself.
5. Since I am driving much later than expected and it is raining, I get caught in traffic and take forever to get back.
6. Since it took so long for me to return with the games, Spencer invites friends over. Gears only has 2 player co-op, so we have to wait until they leave before we can start the campaign.
7. Spencer's headset is broken, so we'll be playing at my house; this isn't really a problem at all (it might even be preferable), but I do like a full screen.

Ok, so far that's everything. Planning sucks.

**Update:** We played 8 for 8 hours, slept for 9, and then played for 4 more. All was well.
