If you've used a computer before, you probably know what wallpaper is. If you haven't, let me say this: Hi! Thanks for making visiting my site the first thing you did on a computer! Anyways, knowing what wallpaper is, you might also know that sometimes finding good wallpaper is hard. Now imagine the difficulty of finding an acceptable wallpaper, and muliply it by 5. That's the difficulty of finding good wallpaper _in widescreen_. Fortunately, I am one of those lucky souls with a widescreen display! YEAH!!

Anyways, thanks to [Red](http://lessgravity.wordpress.com/) I came across some wallpapers that I like... and they all come with widescreen versions! Isn't that just peachy? Apparently I enjoy wallpapers of "photomanipulated landscapes"... from my experience, that means a couple pictures thrown together with the bloom turned up and a lot of clouds and/or preposterously large/numerous celestial bodies photoshopped into the sky. Neat, eh? Oh well, here are some nifty ones:
