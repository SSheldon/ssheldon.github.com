Whenever I got bored on vacation and I needed some mental exercise, I thought about math. The recurring topic was one from way back in middle school: simplifying roots; that is, factoring integers out of irrational roots. It was intriguing and confusing, and I think I got something good out of it. I can't find any equivalent method online, so I figured I'd share mine with the interwebs. Here you go, interwebs: [http://cid-bf9cfc6f077ad90a.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Programming/Root%20Simplifier.cs](http://cid-bf9cfc6f077ad90a.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Programming/Root%20Simplifier.cs)
