I released the first version! More about it [here](http://www.zuneboards.com/forums/download-completed-games/27191-beta-minesweeper.html).

**Update:** Because I love myself so much, here are some things people have said about Zune Minesweeper:

  * "Works like a charm. Thank you for making it!"
  * "One of my favorite games! Thank you so much."
  * "Looks awesome - getting it now."
  * "Thanks for your hard work... works great."
  * "wow looks and plays very well"
  * "love it... finally a minesweeper game"
  * "This is one of those few games that plays with NO bugs at all and is just workable and hassle-free. Thanks a bunch!"
  * "Woot! Thanks so much for making this game... It's also very well done from my experience with it."
