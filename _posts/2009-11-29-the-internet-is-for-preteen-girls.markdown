Brethren and sistren, I come to you today with horrifying news. We all know the internet. We all love the internet! The internet is our home; we love it and all of it's dirty, sordid back alleys. It has given us our own language! We love the internet, even though we all know there are no girls on the internet. But brothers and sisters, hark! While the rest of the world fears Anonymous, lurking in his hidden abode at /b/, we of the internet have our own enemy: preteen girls. They are invading this land that we hold so dear. View, if you will, [this tweet](http://twitter.com/candicejonas/status/6150203790) I encountered. Or, if you will not view it, I will reproduce a portion of it below:

Yes, you did just see that. Someone just said that the Jonas brothers "pone", and then went on to say "kthanksbye". Brothers and sisters of the internet, if you are not gagging now, I ask that you please return to tweeting about the Jonas brothers. Any internet dweller worth their weight in memes knows how to spell "pwn" and "kthxbai". And any such internet dweller would also expect mentions of the "Jo Bros" kept to a minimum! (Except, of course, with regard to Rule 34.) This is an affront to all we hold dear! The internet, _our _internet, is under attack by these Disney Channel denizens! Let us hope, for our sake and for theirs, that this is not a sign of things to come. [For emphasis.](http://xkcd.com/591/)
