_[Analyze the strategies used in [the article](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/29554) to satirize how products are marketed to consumers.]_

Biomagnetic fields. Vibrational biofeedback. Resonator nodules. Comfortrons. At brief glances, all these words appear to be complex scientific jargon. However, when one digs deeper, one realizes there is no substance or real meaning behind these words, even though these are the kinds of words that are frequently used to market products to consumers. In its amusing and well written piece, The Onion has created an effective satire of these methods. The Onion satirizes how products are marketed to consumers by exaggerating the amount of jargon used, showing the science as fake, and pointing out the absurdity of consumer testimonials.

The article contains a plethora of absurd, meaningless jargon to satirize the amount of jargon used to market products. When the creator is describing the product, he talks about the "patented Magna-Grid design" and the "more than 200 isometrically aligned Contour Points™." These words mean nothing, but the fact that the product has names for its design and features gives in an air of authority. The creator also calls the shoe insert a "total foot-rejuvenation system." We aren’t sure what this means, but it sounds nice. Additionally, the article mocks the technique of marketing a product by claiming it is based on ancient Oriental practices when it says that the insoles use "reflexology" which has been "practiced in the Occident for over eleven years." The article does not stop at simply exaggerating the marketing lingo, though.

The Onion satirizes the truth of the science used to sell these products by using blatantly fake science in their satire. The article refers to the "pseudoscience," "scientific-sounding literature," and "appearance of usefulness." By using terms like these, the article is making it plainly clear to the reader that the science is fake but just meant to sound authoritative. Also, in the article, "Terranometry" is said to be a form of science created for the company. This statement will obviously raise questions in the readers’ minds about the reliability of such a science. Finally, the article uses a combination of real and fake scientific words when it states terms like "pain-nuclei," "kilofrankels," and "comfortron." While readers with any scientific knowledge will know these terms are fake, the terms have a scientific tone and air of authority. The Onion, however, satirizes marketing techniques in yet another way.

The Onion continues its satire by pointing out the absurdity of consumer testimonials. One satisfied customer twisted her ankle, but after using the product for seven weeks, she could again walk comfortably. An observant reader would note that a twisted ankle would heal over the course of seven weeks, and such an occurrence has nothing to do with the use of this product. Also, a back-pain sufferer asks, "Why should I pay thousands of dollars to have my spine realigned with physical therapy when I can pay $20 for insoles clearly endorsed by an intelligent-looking man in a white lab coat?" This testimonial mocks consumers’ eagerness to believe something will work if it is cheap and they are told it will work by someone with an air of authority. Lastly, the article states that consumers "are hailing [the product] as a welcome alternative to expensive, effective forms of traditional medicine." The article points out that the consumers recognize that the product is ineffective since they see it as an alternative to effective medicine, yet they still praise the product.

By exaggerating the amount of jargon used, showing the science as fake, and pointing out the absurdity of consumer testimonials, The Onion satirizes how products are marketed to consumers. In picking out common techniques and revealing how laughable they truly are, The Onion opens its readers’ eyes to the inanity of these advertisements. After reading this essay, readers will find themselves smiling and shaking their heads as they see an advertisement on TV touting a product’s patented design and use of the healing power of crystals.
