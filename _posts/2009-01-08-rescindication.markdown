The world was not happy [when I declared that it didn't hate me when it comes to school](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/semester-2-schedule/). It decided to kick me.

We just did auditions for band. I got a 76, [lower than my last score](http://sasheldon.wordpress.com/2008/09/25/auditions/), and low enough to put 10 flutes in front of me. Looks like I won't be in Wind Ensemble next year. Hooray for 4 years in Symphonic Band!

We got back the results from the US History test we just took. It was a perfect storm, what with my recent inabilty to stay awake while reading the history book and the fact that I read all of the sections before break. Blegh. I didn't do well on the multiple choice (usually my strong point) and didn't even finish my Essay question, so the results from that won't be pretty either. If my grade drops in that class, I will be distraught.

We took a Physics "test" today. It really angered me. In an attempt to make it easier on us, the test was split into three parts. First, all of us worked on one part individually; we then proceeded to gather with 2 others (not of our choosing) who did the other parts of the test and he let us make corrections on our group member's portions. Unfortunately, he only allowed us to fix _some_ of their mistakes and he gave us a time limit for each portion. It was horrible. I was rushing to try and figure out my partners' tests because in most cases they had no idea what was going on. We were only allowed to fix one portion of the test at a time, and these time periods were of equal length. This was awful when it came time to fix my portion, because it was already correct. We proceeded to sit for 12 minutes while we had just turned in part of our test that we hadn't finished. I abso-fuckin'-lutely hate being forced to rely on other people when I can't choose them. I don't trust most people; I barely trust my friends when it comes to my grades!
