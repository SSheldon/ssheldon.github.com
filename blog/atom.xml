    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The next version of <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is packed full of
<a href="https://gist.github.com/imathis/e9c2ee2406e93c4269e8">awesome improvements</a>.
Octopress will change massively to be more extensible and customizable while
still being as powerful and easy as ever; as such, this update has been in
development for a long time, still not having released officially.</p>

<p>In anticipation of this update, I periodically check the
<a href="https://twitter.com/octopress">Octopress Twitter</a> for news and have
encountered many release date estimates. Estimating time for development is
<a href="http://blog.hut8labs.com/coding-fast-and-slow.html">notoriously difficult</a>,
so I&rsquo;ve compiled a lighthearted Twitter history of Octopress 2.0&rsquo;s
successor and its estimated release dates.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The follow-up to Octopress 2.0 was originally envisioned as a much smaller set
of changes to be called Octopress 2.1. The release of this version was first
mentioned in March of 2012 as &ldquo;soon&rdquo;.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/apcarballo">@apcarballo</a> Glad to help. That will be shipping in 2.1 (soon).</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/184723922556686337">March 27, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>By May, the outlook for Octopress 2.1 was looking good enough that its release
seemed imminent, within a &ldquo;day or two&rdquo;.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jameslutley">@jameslutley</a> Beautiful work. Have you tried 2.1 yet? I&#39;m hoping to release it in the next day or two.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/205288498591309824">May 23, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>But it was not to be! A week and a half later, in June, 2.1 was still looking
as though it would release &ldquo;soon&rdquo;.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ScottMuc">@ScottMuc</a> 2.1 should be releasing soon. It has lots of goodies and fixes.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/209408163571707905">June 3, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Next month, July, enough progress had been made to offer a new estimate that
2.1 would release in a &ldquo;week or two&rdquo;.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/fannheyward">@fannheyward</a> It&#39;ll be released once I finish a couple of remaining features. I&#39;m hoping that&#39;ll be in the next week or two.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/219804276447379456">July 2, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>It was not until 4 months later in November that the next estimation was made
that 2.1 would be released before the end of 2012.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sebdah">@sebdah</a> I can’t give a solid date right now. But I expect to have a release before years end.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/268762061197148161">November 14, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>With an acknowledgement of the difficulty in estimating, by January 2013
Octopress 2.1 was predicted to be completed &ldquo;soon&rdquo;.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/vassie">@vassie</a> We&#39;re working on an asset pipeline, fixing any critical bugs and setting up a migration for 2.0. It&#39;s hard to estimate, but soon.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/289446177575948289">January 10, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>In February, it seemed that the eagerly awaited update would be finalized
within a &ldquo;month or two&rdquo;.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/inti_minty">@inti_minty</a> right now it’s not entirely stable. We’re working on a few large features then we’ll release it in the next month or two.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/300027017397665793">February 8, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>With the tremendous amount of effort that had gone into the update, it seemed
more fitting that the major version change, so it would instead be released as
<a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/status/306972342582657026">Octopress 3.0</a>.</p>

<p>By March, this 3.0 update&rsquo;s release date was further clarified to &ldquo;mid April&rdquo;.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adadslife">@adadslife</a> Right now, 2.1 is under pretty active development. We’re shooting for a mid April release, so it might be a good idea to wait.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/314553072535887872">March 21, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>My mid April, though, it seemed more likely that the release would occur
later in the month.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kaushikgopal">@kaushikgopal</a> I’d hold off for the next release. It’s in flux right now. We’re hoping for late April.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/323868125709864960">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Although an April release had been missed, by late May it seemed that there
would be a 3.0 release candidate available within a &ldquo;month or so&rdquo;.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/salout_de">@salout_de</a> We’re currently working through getting some core functionality working, but I’ll be announcing an RC in the next month or so.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/339044122801360896">May 27, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>At the end of June, the ambitious Octopress 3.0 was still predicted to arrive
during the summer.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/atlgeek007">@atlgeek007</a> Going well. We’re targeting a summer release, still lots to do though. :)</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/351439257996505088">June 30, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://sasheldon.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>And so we still anticipate the official release of this update that will
redefine Octopress. This does showcase a neat benefit of open source;
despite not being officilly released, you can try out 3.0 and closely follow
its development <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/tree/2.1">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of Octopress&#8217; history of imprecise estimates, I have great faith in
its developers to deliver such an ambitious update. I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out on
Twitter for an announcement that Octopress 3.0 has finally been perfected!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Update (Aug 18, 2013):</strong>
By the end of July, there was still &ldquo;a ways to go&rdquo; on Octopress 3.0, but
version 2.1 of Octopress was resurrected as a smaller, incremental upgrade on
the way to Octopress 3.0.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/atlgeek007">@atlgeek007</a> we still have a ways to go. Right now I’m working on 2.1 which adds support for Jekyll 1.0 and uses Guard for watching files.</p>&mdash; Octopress (@octopress) <a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/statuses/361299670313615360">July 28, 2013</a></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like git; if I could keep everything under version control, I would.
I&rsquo;ve started writing all my papers in LaTeX instead of Word, not only because
it&rsquo;s cleaner and can provide more control, but because then I can version
control them. Hell, I&rsquo;ve even started keeping my Borderlands 2 game saves
backed up in a git repository.</p>

<p>Imagine my delight, then, when I discovered <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.
Octopress is a framework that makes it really easy to generate a blog just from
a set of markdown files that can be hosted on
<a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. I&rsquo;ve already been using GitHub to
host my personal website, and using it to host a blog would be pretty swell.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked through the documentation to get a blog up and running; after all,
I have homework to be working on right now, so I need to find something else to
do. Nevermind the fact that I never actually put in the effort to blog or can
come up with interesting topics; if nothing else, this was just an exercise to
test out Octopress and to become more familiar with the features of GitHub
pages.</p>
