    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like git; if I could keep everything under version control, I would.
I&#8217;ve started writing all my papers in LaTeX instead of Word, not only because
it&#8217;s cleaner and can provide more control, but because then I can version
control them. Hell, I&#8217;ve even started keeping my Borderlands 2 game saves
backed up in a git repository.</p>

<p>Imagine my delight, then, when I discovered <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.
Octopress is a framework that makes it really easy to generate a blog just from
a set of markdown files that can be hosted on
<a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. I&#8217;ve already been using GitHub to
host my personal website, and using it to host a blog would be pretty swell.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve worked through the documentation to get a blog up and running; after all,
I have homework to be working on right now, so I need to find something else to
do. Nevermind the fact that I never actually put in the effort to blog or can
come up with interesting topics; if nothing else, this was just an exercise to
test out Octopress and to become more familiar with the features of GitHub
pages.</p>
